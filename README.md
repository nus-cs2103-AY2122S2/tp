### Introduction
camNUS is a **desktop app** for Teaching Assistants (TAs) to **manage their own contacts, as well as assessments and class participation among students** in their contact book. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
