* This application is designed for **Recruiters for Tech companies** who have many candidates to track.


* Usage:
  * Schedule interviews with potential applicants
  * Track job candidates through the hiring process


* The application is optimised for Command Line Interface (_CLI_) users. However, a graphic user interface (_GUI_) is
  also offered. 


* This is done to allow power users to accomplish tasks much quicker through the use of commands


* It is named `HireLah` because it should make the recruiter utter these words when they are using it `"aiyo just 
  HireLah!"` 


* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[HireLah Product Website](https://ay2122s2-cs2103-w17-4.github.io/tp/)**.


* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)
