## Introduction
Networkers is a **desktop app for managing contacts for networks, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** 
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, Networkers can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
