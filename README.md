# ArchDuke

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

**ArchDuke** is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still 
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, ArchDuke can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
