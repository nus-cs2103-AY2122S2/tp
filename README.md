**LinkedOUT** is the only application that any **experienced recruiter needs.** 

It allows recruiters to **keep track of many applicants, and the job they applied for.** 

You can **store** their contact details, skills and the round of their application, **all in one place**.

For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[LinkedOUT Product Website](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-t09-2.github.io/tp/)**.
