This is **Tinner**, a CLI-centric application which helps university students organise their tech internship applications with ease. It allows users to store relevant company contact details, keeps track of the application progress, gives timely reminders and also encourages users to jot down notes in order to improve and secure other applications.

We used the name `Tinner` as it's an anagram for intern and since that is our product's demographic, we felt that it would be fitting as it reminds us to always think about our users during the development process.
