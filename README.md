* This app is **a contact book for university students, teaching assistants and school admin**. <br>
  Example usages:
  * Save up classmate's or student's contact information
  * Categorize students by tags
* The application is for users who prefer to use a platform with a simplistic GUI
* It is named `UNite` because the application is meant to be used in a university context, and we hope this can help improve communication within the campus and thus 'unite' everyone.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[UNite Product Website](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w12-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This product is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org). If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
