### NUSocials

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _NUSocials_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* Example usages:
  * Keep track of how and where you met each contact
  * Search for contacts
  * Plan and view events involving your contacts
* It is named `NUSocials` because we envision an application that helps NUS students maintain a professional contact list to help them stay socially connected.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[NUSocials Product Website](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w11-1.github.io/tp/)**.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project, created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
