# TAilor

TAilor is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a Computer Science Teaching Assistant who can type
fast, TAilor can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
<br>

## Usages
TAilor can (as of v1.2):
* add, delete, edit and view student's contact details
* store the contact details of your students
* contact students in bulk or individually </p>

Additional features can be found in our **[User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md)**.
