_Find yourself having trouble managing all the important friendships in your university life?_

**Amigos** is here to help!

With **Amigos**, you can:
* Keep track of important details about your friends
* Maintain your friendships by keeping up-to-date logs about your friends, such as their likes/dislikes, aspirations and so on!
* Remember key events you are doing with friends
* Gain valuable insights about your friends, like the last time you met up with them.

Amigos is also _super fast_ to use, and optimized for keyboard input while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

For more information on how to get started, check out the **[Amigos User Guide](https://ay2122s2-cs2103-f09-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html)**.
