* **TAddressBook** is a student project based on [AddressBook Level 3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3). It is a desktop application created with the aim of helping CS2030S Teaching Assistants (TAs) keep track of student's lab assignments.
* It is named `TAddressBook` because it was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[TAddressBook Product Website](https://ay2122s2-cs2103-f10-1.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
