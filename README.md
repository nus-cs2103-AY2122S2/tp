## Teaching Assistant Contact Helper (TACH)

* This is a team project for a desktop application (called **TACH**) used by Computer Science (**CS**)
Teaching Assistants (**TA**s) in NUS to manage and keep track of their students in
the TAs tutorial groups.
* **TACH** aims to solve problems of CS TAs regarding management and alleviate their workload by:
  * Managing their students in an organised manner
  * Easily access a student's contact details like their email or Telegram
  * Find students either by their name or by their tutorial group
* It is named `Teaching Assistant Contact Helper` (`TACH` for short) because it helps TAs with their students' contacts.
* For detailed documentation of this project, see the
**[TACH Product Website](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w15-3.github.io/tp/)**
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the
[SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
