## About Expense Expert

- This is **Expense Expert**.<br>
  Example usages:
  - as a budgeting tool to inform users of their remaining budget
  - as a expense tracker to help users track their expense
- The project simulates an expense tracker.
  - It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  - It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
- It is named `Expense Expert` because of the intuition that this project seeks to help our users track and manage their finances better.
