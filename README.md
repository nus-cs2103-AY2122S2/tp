# InternBuddy
InternBuddy is a desktop app for managing companies for internships, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, InternBuddy can get your internship management deliverables done faster than traditional GUI apps.

InternBuddy provides you a way to plan and organize all your internship details on a single application, with intuitive 
UI to make your Job Seeking journey a smooth road.
