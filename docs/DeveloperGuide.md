## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete P/John Doe`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Schedule` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete P/John Doe")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete P/John Doe` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="900" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the MyGM data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Schedule` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Schedule>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)




### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 1. Add feature

#### 1.1 Add Player
#### Proposed implementation
The proposed add player functionality will create a new `Person` with the specified attributes such as `Height`, `Weight`, `JerseyNumber` etc and store the `Person` inside `UniquePersonList`.
#### Design Consideration
**Aspect: How to navigate from `Person` to `Lineup` he belongs to:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store `LineupName` of `Lineup` as attributes of `Person`
  * Pros: Easy to implement and navigate.
  * Cons: Need to impose restrictions on `LineupName` such that `Lineup` cannot have duplicate names. Risk of multiple source of truth.

* **Alternative 2:** Iterate through `UniqueLineupList` to find `Lineup` a `Person` is in
  * Pros: Avoid multiple source of truth.
  * Cons: Display of all `Person` in all `Lineup` can be time expensive when there are a large number of `Linenup` and `Person`.

#### 1.2 Add lineup
#### Proposed implementation
The proposed add lineup functionality will create a new lineup and store it inside `UniqueLineupList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add lineup operation works:
![AddLineup](images/Add.png)

#### Design Consideration
**Aspect: Where to store lineup data:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store its name as person's attributes.
  * Pros: Easy to implement. No need to have another json file for storage.
  * Cons: Need to search through all players to create all lineups for each relaunch of the application.

* **Alternative 2:** Store lineups in the same json file as person.
  * Pros: Easy to implement load data.
  * Cons: Troublesome to save all data.

#### 1.3 Add schedule
#### Proposed implementation
The proposed add schedule functionality will create a new schedule and store it inside `UniqueScheduleList`.
#### Design Consideration
**Aspect: Are multiple schedules allowed on the same day:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow multiple schedules on the same date.
  * Pros: Easy to implement. No need to check for duplicate of dates.
  * Cons: Timetable clash can happen.

* **Alternative 2:** Disallow multiple schedules on the same date.
  * Pros: Avoid timetable clash.
  * Cons: Some more implementations needed. Lower flexibility as only one event is allowed for one day.

### 2. Delete feature

#### 2.1 Delete player
#### Proposed implementation
The proposed delete player functionality will delete an existing player from `UniquePlayerList`,
as well as from all lineups in `UniqueLineupList` that contains the player.

#### Design Consideration

**Aspect: How to delete a person from `UniquePersonList` by its name?**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterate through `internalList` to find the person, then delete it.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Slower for large quantity of players, but acceptable within our requirement.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a HashMap from `Name` to each person, then access it quickly.
  * Pros: More efficient.
  * Cons: Hard to implement and time-consuming.


#### 2.2 Delete lineup
#### Proposed implementation
The proposed delete lineup functionality will delete an existing lineup from `UniqueLineupList` and remove all players from the lineup.
![DeleteLineup](images/Delete.png)
#### Design Consideration
**Aspect: How to remove lineup from `UniqueLineupList`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Remove directly from the internal list.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: The status of AddressBook is not modified and `updateItem()` of GUI needs to be triggered manually.

* **Alternative 2:** Create another list without the player to be removed.
  * Pros: The `updateItem()` of GUI will be automatically triggered.
  * Cons: Troublesome to implement and time expensive.

#### 2.3 Delete player from lineup
#### Proposed implementation
After checking that both input `Person` and `Lineup` are valid and the `Person` is in `Lineup`, the lineup's `LineupName` will be removed from `Person`. Then the player will be removed from lineup's `Person` list.


#### 2.4 Delete schedule
#### Proposed implementation
After checking that the input `index` is valid, the `Schedule` with the specified `index` will be removed from `UniqueScheduleList`.
#### Design Consideration
**Aspect: How to refer to a specific schedule:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the index as in the display.
  * Pros: Easy to use. Allow duplicate schedule names.
  * Cons: Users will need to view the schedule they want to edit before starting to edit.
* **Alternative 2:** Use the name of the schedule.
  * Pros: Each schedule has unique reference.
  * Cons: Duplicate schedule names will not be allowed.


### 3. Edit feature

#### 3.1 Edit player
#### Proposed implementation
The proposed edit player functionality will update all specified attributes of the `Person`, such as `Weight`, `Height`, `JerseyNumber` etc.
Meanwhile, the `Person` will be updated in `LineupPlayersList` of all the lineups this player belongs to.
#### Design Consideration
**Aspect: How does `edit` behave for tags:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Remove all previous tags and add only specified tags to the player.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: User needs to key in all tags in order to add/delete/change one tag.
* **Alternative 2:** Differentiate prefixes for add tag and delete tag.
  * Pros: Simpler to use for users.
  * Cons: Difficult to implement.
#### 3.2 Edit lineup
#### Proposed implementation
The proposed edit lineup functionality will update the name of a lineup.
Meanwhile, the `lineups` attribute of each person should also be updated if the person is in the lineup.
![Edit Lineup](images/Edit.png)
#### Design Consideration
**Aspect: How to locate lineup in `UniqueLineupList`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterate through all lineups to locate it.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Slower for large quantity of lineups, but sufficient within our requirement.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a HashMap to store the mappings between `LineupName` and `Lineup`.
    * Pros: Time efficient.
    * Cons: Troublesome to implement.

#### 3.3 Edit schedule
#### Proposed implementation
The proposed edit schedule will update specified attributes such as `ScheduleName`, `ScheduleDescription` for `Schedule` at the specific `index`.

### 4. View feature

#### 4.1 View player
#### Proposed implementation
The proposed view player functionality queries players from the existing UniquePersonList. The players returned is
dependent on the keywords specified in the command. The proposed view mechanism is facilitated by ModelManger which
keeps a FilteredList of players. Note that this FilteredList of players is updated via a specified Predicate.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:
- `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person>) - Filters internal storage via a Predicate<Person> specification`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user wants to view player name with james in its name.

Step 3. The user executes `view P/james`. The view command will check if the inputs are valid, and then parsed
(similar to the other CRUD commands) before using these inputs to create conditional `Predicate<>` instances (eg. NameContainsKeywordsPredicate).
The predicates are then combined and used to filter the `FilteredList<Person>`. The GUI will then display the player items in the filtered list.

#### Design Consideration
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Optional prefix for user to specify view criteria.<br> Pros: More flexibility for user. <br> Cons: Harder to implement as there are more cases to handle.
* **Alternative 2**: Compulsory flag <br> Pros: Easier to implement. <br> Cons: Lesser flexibility for user.

#### 4.2 View lineup
![view](images/View.png)
#### Proposed implementation
The proposed implementation of view lineup has two variants.\
`view L/` displays all lineups and all players inside some lineups.\
`view L/LINEUP` displays all players inside the specific `LINEUP`.

#### 4.3 View schedule
#### Proposed implementation
The proposed implementation of view schedule has three variants, which differ in Step 2 and 3 of user scenarios.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2a. The user wants to view active schedules happening at future dates.\
Step 3a. The user executes `view S/`.  The command will set the predicate for `FilteredList<Schedule>` to be `PREDICATE_SHOW_ACTIVE_SCHEDULES`.

Step 2b. The user wants to view all historically added schedules.\
Step 3b. The user executes `view S/ a/all`.  The command will set the predicate for `FilteredList<Schedule>` to be `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_SCHEDULES`.

Step 2c. The user wants to view archived schedules only.\
Step 3c. The user executes `view S/ a/archive`.  The command will set the predicate for `FilteredList<Schedule>` to be `PREDICATE_SHOW_ARCHIVED_SCHEDULES`.

step 2d. The user wants to view schedules on a specific date.\
Step 3d. The user executes `view S/ d/2000-11-29`. The command will set the predicate for `FilteredList<Schedule>` to be a new `ScheduleOnThisDatePredicate`.

#### Design Consideration
**Aspect: How to set the default display of schedule to active schedules only:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set the predicate at initialization of `AddressBook`.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Risk breaking abstraction principle because `LogicManager` is implementing for `ModelManager`.

* **Alternative 2:** Set the predicate inside `ModelManager`.
  * Pros: `LogicManager` will not call functions other than `get...()` of `ModelManager`.
  * Cons: Difficult to implement.

### 5. Put feature
#### Proposed implementation
Puts a `Person` into a `Lineup`. Meanwhile the `LineupName` will be stored as an attribute of the `Person` in the list `lineups`.

![put](images/Put.png)

#### Design Consideration
**Aspect: How to navigate from player to lineup:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store `LineupName` as an attribute of player.
  * Pros: Easy to Implement. Easy to navigate.
  * Cons: Risk of multiple source of truth. More prone to bugs.

* **Alternative 2:** Iterate through lineups to find the ones a player belongs to.
  * Pros: No multiple source of truth.
  * Cons: Iteration might be time-consuming.

**Aspect: How to keep track the `Lineup` a `Person` belongs to**

**Alternative 1: (Current choice)** Attributes of `Person`

Pros: Efficient and easy to find `Lineup` of `Person`

Cons: Need to update both `Person` and `Lineup`

**Alternative 2**: Using `Lineup` Only

Pros: Only need to update `Lineup`

Cons: Need to iterate through all `Lineup` to find out the `Lineup` a `Person` belongs to

### 6. Sort feature

The sorting feature is facilitated by the ModelManager. It helps to pass the comparator from the `SortCommand` class to `AddressBook`.

#### Proposed implementation
`ModelManager#sortPersonsInMyGM(Comparator<X>)` where X can be `Height`, `Weight` or `JerseyNumber` is passed to `AddressBook` to sort the `ObservableList<Person>` inside `UniquePersonList` class. 
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application after having used it for a while.

Step 2. The user wants to sort the existing players in descending order of height.

Step 3. The user executes `sort h/desc`. The `sort` command will check if the inputs are valid, and then parsed (similar to previous examples) before creating a `Comparator<Height>`  instances. The `Comparator<Height>` will then be use to sort the `ObservableList<Person>` and the GUI will then display the players in descending order of height.

#### Design Consideration
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow user to have the freedom to specify sorting in ascending or descending order.
    * Pros: Flexibility for the user.
    * Cons: Harder to implement as another condition has to be considered and thus, creating a different comparator.

* **Alternative 2:** Only allow sorting in ascending order
    * Pros: Easy to implement and has shorter code.
    * Cons: Lesser Flexibility for the user.

### 7. Clear feature

#### Proposed implementation
Purges all data by cleaning `addressbook.json`.

### 8. Theme feature

### Proposed implementation
Changes the theme of the UI between light and dark mode.
The theme feature is implemented in the `ThemeCommand` class. The following is an example usage scenario.

![Theme](images/ThemeSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user executes theme to switch to a different theme.

Step 2. The UI component then passes the target theme to the `LogicManager` class in `Logic` component.

Step 3. The `Logic` component executes the command which set the boolean isToLight or isToDark to true given the input which is then passed back to the UI component.

Step 4. The `UI` component loads the appropriate fxml file containing the target theme and is displayed back to the user.
