## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" alt="Architecture diagram" width="285">

The Architecture Diagram given above explains the high-level design of the app.

Given below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

<h5>Main components of the architecture</h5>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ibook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ibook/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes and connects the components in the correct sequence.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The core of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Lastly, [**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h5>How the architecture components interact with each other</h5>

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Sequence diagram for the architecture" width="600">

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside components from being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" alt="Component Managers" width="320" />

The sections below give more details about each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

**API**: [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/ibook/ui/i.java).

The diagram below shows a simplified view of the `UI` component.

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" alt="Structure of the UI Component" width="480" />

`XXX_Ui` represents `CommandBox`, `ProductTable`, `PopupHandler`, `ControlBox`, etc.

The UI consists of a `UiManager` that implements the Facade interface `UI`. `UiManager` consists of a `MainWindow` that holds all UI components of the application. `UiComponent` is an abstract class that contains a reference to the MainWindow.

By having `XXX_Ui` inherit from `UiComponent`, we allow navigation from `XXX_Ui` to `MainWindow`. The navigation is helpful for some UI components that need to call methods in `UiManager`.

For example, `CommandBox` calls the method `executeCommand` in `MainWindow` when the user enters a command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h4>The Table component</h4>

UI components that are related to the main display table are grouped under the `Table` package. The diagram below shows a simplified internal structure of `Table`.

<img src="images/UiTableDiagram.png" alt="Structure of the Table Component" width="350">

The `MainWindow` contains a `ProductTable` that holds multiple `ProductCard` objects that represent `Product`. Subsequently, each `ProductCard` may contain `ItemTable` which has multiple `ItemCard` objects to represent `Item`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h4>The Popup component</h4>

UI components that are related to a popup window are grouped under the `Popup` package. The diagram below shows a simplified internal structure of `Popup`.

<img src="images/UiPopupDiagram.png" alt="Structure of the Popup UI" width="320">

`PopupXXX` represents `PopupAddProduct`, `PopupUpdateProduct`, `PopupAddItem`, etc. The `MainWindow` contains a `PopupHandler` that provides APIs for operations related to a popup window.

Every popup inherits the `Popup` abstract class which contains the implementation of the common methods required in all popups, e.g `show()`, `hide()`, `setFeedbackToUser()`, etc.

The abstract class `Popup` inherits `UiComponent` for navigability to `MainWindow`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h4>The Control component</h4>

UI components that are related to the `ControlBox` are grouped under the `Control` package. The diagram below shows a simplified internal structure of `Control`.

<img src="images/UiControlDiagram.png" alt="Structure of the Control UI" width="280">

The `ControlBox` is the box located just above the main display table. It holds the <img class="btn" align="center" src="images/ui-icons/add-product.png" alt="Add Product" height="25"/> button and `Filter` tags.

The `MainWindow` contains a `ControlBox` that holds multiple `Filter` that represents each `AttributeFilter`.

<h4>More about UI</h4>

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in corresponding `.fxml` files that are in the [`src/main/resources/view`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view) folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/ibook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The CSS files can be found in [`src/main/resources/view/css`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/css).

The images used are located in [`src/main/resources/images`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/images).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Product`, `Item` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API**: [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ibook/logic/Logic.java)

The diagram below shows a simplified view of the `Logic` component.

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `IBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a product).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

Commands are separated into different packages depending on their functionalities. Thus, the commands package includes the item package for item commands and the product package for product commands. The rest of the commands that do not fit into those two are directly under the command package.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
   :information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X). But due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `IBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `IBookParser` returns as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g. during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API**: [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ibook/model/Model.java)

The diagram below shows a simplified view of the `Model` component.

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the IBook data, i.e. all `Product` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueProductList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Product` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Product>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the current `ProductFilter` which is applied to the _filtered_ list.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

A more detailed representation of the `Product` class is shown below which includes more details regarding the `Item` class.

* The `Item` object enforces a two-way relationship with a `Product`.
* An `Item` can only belong to one `Product`, but a `Product` can contain many `Item` objects.

<img src="images/DetailedModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API**: [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ibook/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both IBook data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `IBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one when only one functionality is needed.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.ibook.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Popups

#### Implementation

The diagram below shows a simplified internal structure of `Popup`.

<img src="images/UiPopupDiagram.png" alt="Structure of the Popup UI" width="300">

`PopupXXX` represents `PopupAddProduct`, `PopupUpdateProduct`, `PopupAddItem`, etc

The implementation of popups is facilitated by the `PopupHandler` class and the `Popup` abstract class. Each popup is contained by `PopupHandler` which provides APIs for operations related to the popup.

The API provided by `PopupHandler` are:
* `isShowing()` – Checks if any one of the popups is showing.
* `setFeedbackToUser(String)` – Shows feedback to the user in the showing popup.
* `showPopupXXX()` – Shows `PopupXXX`.
* `hidePopup()` – Hides the showing popup.

The `showPopupXXX()` method in `PopupHandler` will make sure that at most one popup is showing at a time. This is to prevent overcrowding the user's screen.

Every popup is inherited from the `Popup` abstract class which contains the implementation of the common methods required in all popups.

The methods in `Popup` are:
* `show()` — Shows the popup window.
* `hide()` — Hides the popup window.
* `isShowing()` — Checks if the popup is showing.
* `setFeedbackToUser(String)` — Shows feedback to the user in the popup.
* `execute(String)` — Executes the given command.

#### Showing a Popup

The following sequence diagram shows how a `Popup` is displayed once a button is clicked.

![Show Popup](images/ShowPopupSequenceDiagram.png)

`XXX_Ui` represents UI components that have a button that will open a popup once clicked, e.g. `ControlBox`, `ProductCard`, `ItemCard`, etc.

`PopupYYY` represents different types of `Popup`, e.g. `PopupAddProduct`, `PopupUpdateProduct`, `PopupAddItem`, etc.

As seen from the diagram, the components call `showPopupXXX(...)` in `MainWindow` instead of calling it from `PopupHandler` directly.

This is to reduce coupling between the UI components by removing the dependency on `PopupHandler` to open a popup. Also, it avoids the issue of passing `PopupHandler` into a deeply nested UI component.

#### Executing commands in Popup

The sequence diagram below describes a successful execution of a command in a popup.

![Execute Popup](images/ExecutePopupSequenceDiagram.png)

`PopupYYY` represents different types of `Popup`, e.g. `PopupAddProduct`, `PopupUpdateProduct`, `PopupAddItem`, etc.

When a user clicks a button in `PopupYYY`, the associated command is generated from the inputs. The command is then passed to `MainWindow` for execution. This process is similar to how a command is executed from `CommandBox`.

The `commandResult` will then be sent to `ResultWindow` for display and `PopupYYY` will be hidden.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to handle popup**
* **Alternative 1:** Pass in popups created at `MainWindow` to UI components that require it.
  * Pros: Fewer function calls and better performance.
  * Cons: Increases coupling as these popups might be required by deeply nested components. <br> e.g `ItemCard` has to call `PopupModifyItem` but it resides in `MainWindow > ProductTable > ItemTable`. This causes `ProductTable` and `ItemTable` to have an unnecessary dependency on `PopupModifyItem`.

   &nbsp;

* **Alternative 2:** Create a popup in UI components that require it.
  * Pros: Easy solution to reduce coupling.
  * Cons:
    1. Difficult to manage pop-ups and check whether the popups are currently showing.
    2. Two of the same popups can be opened at the same time.

   &nbsp;

* **Alternative 3 (current choice):** Create `PopupHandler` in `MainWindow` and provide methods for all UI components to open a `Popup`.
  * Pros: Centralized control for pop-ups and reduces coupling.
  * Cons:
    1. Increases complexity for `MainWindow`.
    2. Less efficient, as more function calls are required.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Product

#### Implementation

The implementation of product is entirely governed by the `Product` class. The `Product` class is immutable and guarantees that all fields are valid and immutable as well.

Thus updating a product will create a new `Product` object. The items from the original `Product` will be copied entirely into the new `Product` object.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `Update` command works:

<img src="images/UpdateExecutionSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: How to design the `Product` structure**

* **Alternative 1:** Make `Product` mutable.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Hard to track state in undo/redo feature.

   &nbsp;

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Make `Product` immutable.
  * Pros: Removes the need for listeners for UI to track product states.
  * Cons: The cost of updating a product may be huge.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Product filters

#### Implementation

The implementation of product filter is facilitated by the `ProductFilter` class and the `AttributeFilter` class. `ProductFilter` contains a list of `AttributeFilter` which specifies the filter for the individual attributes of a product that was queried in the `Find` command.

Both the `ProductFilter` as well as the `AttributeFilter` has a `test()` method to test whether a given `Product` fulfils the query specified by the user.

Given below is the class diagram of the `ProductFilter` class and the `AttributeFilter` class.

<img src="images/ProductFilterClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram below shows how the `FindCommand` object is created:

<img src="images/FindCreationSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

The sequence diagram below shows how the `FindCommand` object is executed:

<img src="images/FindExecutionSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

As different attributes have different constraints, the `parse()` method in the `FindCommandParser` checks that all the attributes are valid before creating the `AttributeFilter` and the `FindCommand` objects. If there are any invalid attributes, an exception would be thrown.

When executing the `FindCommand`, the `clearProductFilters()` method of the `Model` would be called to ensure that previous filters are removed. The individual `AttributeFilter`s would then be applied by calling the `addProductFilter()` method in the `Model` class. This would then update the list of filtered products by checking if the product fulfils every condition in the `AttributeFilter` (i.e. returning true for when the `test()` method is called with `Product` as the argument).

The updated filtered product list would then be displayed in the GUI.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** Some `AttributeFilter`s like `NameFilter`, `CategoryFilter` and `DescriptionFilter` have the capability to do partial matching so the query given does not have to exactly match the actual product.

</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to filter the products:**

* **Alternative 1:** Create a single predicate as the product filter.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: The user does not have fine-grained control over the current filter.

    &nbsp;

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Create a `ProductFilter` that contains a list of `AttributeFilter`
    * Pros: Allow the UI to display the individual `AttributeFilter` being applied and delete any one of them individually.
    * Cons: More complicated to implement.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Item

#### Implementation

The `Item` class is implemented to encapsulate two data fields, `ExpiryDate` and `Quantity`. `Product` has a one-to-many relationship with `Item`, i.e. one `Product` can have multiple `Item` objects under it.

Listed below are the few behavioural requirements for `Item`, along with the classes/interfaces related to it.

* A `Product` must not have two `Item` objects that are considered the same, this is enforced by `UniqueItemList`.
* An `Item` without a `Parent` is characterised using the `ItemDescriptor`.

`ItemDescriptor` contains an `ItemDescriptor#toItem(Product)` method to ensure the associated `Product` is given before creating the `Item` object.

The motivation for such implementation is due to the parsing of the `add-item` command when the fields of `Item` need to be populated before the associated `Product` is retrieved. We wanted to enforce the relationship between `Item` and `Product` to reduce unforeseen misuses and bugs.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

##### Adding an Item

The sequence diagram below shows how `add-item 1 e:2022-12-13 q:10` is handled:

![Sequence diagram for `add-item` command](images/AddItemSequenceDiagram.svg)

<img src="images/AddItemToModelSequenceDiagram.svg" alt="Detailed sequence diagram for the command execution" width="450">

The sequence diagram below shows how an `Item` is added to a `Product`'s `UniqueItemList`. This happens within `ModelManager` which implements the interface `Model` containing the method `Model#addItem(Product, Item)`.

<img src="images/AddItemToUniqueItemList.svg" alt="Sequence diagram for `ModelManager#addItem` internal details" width="650">

##### Updating and deleting an Item
These two operations are similar to adding an `Item` as shown in the section above.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to create `Item` during the parsing of an `add-item` command:**

* **Alternative 1:** Retrieve the respective `Product` within the parser.
    * Pros: Easy solution.
    * Cons: Allows the parser to interact with model and logic, and increases coupling.

      &nbsp;

* **Alternative 2:** Create a command object with each field as a parameter.
    * Pros: Easy solution.
    * Cons: Complicates the `AddItemCommand` constructor and requires modification of constructor signature whenever there are updates to `Item` fields.

      &nbsp;

* **Alternative 3 (current choice):** `ItemDescriptor` to temporarily hold the fields' value, then converted to `Item` later when `Product` is specified.
    * Pros: Good abstraction.
    * Cons: Requires an extra class to be created.


### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `ReversibleIBook`. It extends `IBook` with versions of methods that are reversible and uses `StateChangeRecorder` to record all changes made to `IBook`, which internally stores changes as `StateChange`. `ReversibleIBook` implements the following operations:

* `prepareForChanges()`  —  Prepares a clean workspace to record the next possible changes.
* `saveChanges()`  —  Saves all changes made to `IBook` as a `StateChange` into `StateChangeRecorder`.
* `undo()`  —  Reverts the most recent changes.
* `redo()`  —  Restores the most recently undone changes.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#prepareIBookForChanges()`, `Model#saveIBookChanges()`, `Model#undoIBook()` and `Model#redoIBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ReversibleIBook` will be initialized, which in turn initializes `StateChangeRecorder` with a `stateChanges` list consisting of zero `StateChange` records.

<img src="images/UndoRedoState0.png" width="500" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 3` command to delete the 3rd product in the iBook. The `delete` command calls `Model#saveIBookChanges()` after its execution, causing changes made to iBook to be recorded as a `StateChange` and stored in the `stateChanges` list. The `currentStateChange` is now pointing to this most recent `StateChange`.

<img src="images/UndoRedoState1.png" width="500" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n:Maggie​ p:2.00` to add a new product. This command also calls `Model#saveIBookChanges()`, causing another `StateChange` to be saved into the `stateChanges` list.

<img src="images/UndoRedoState2.png" width="500" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#saveIBookChanges()`, so no `StateChange` will be saved into the `stateChanges` list.

</div>

<br>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the product was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoIBook()`, which will get and execute the actions needed to revert this change. `currentStateChange` will then move once to the left, pointing to the most recent `stateChange` (with respect to the state of `IBook` after the `undo` command).

<img src="images/UndoRedoState3.png" width="500" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStateChange` is not pointing to a valid `StateChange` (for example when there is no record in the `stateChanges` list), then there are no changes to revert. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoIBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

<br>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<img src="images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

<br>

The `redo` command does exactly the opposite  —  it calls `Model#redoIBook()`, which moves the `currentStateChange` to the right by one, pointing to the previously reverted changes, then performs the actions needed to restore them.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStateChange` is pointing at the latest record of the `stateChanges` list, then there are no reverted changes to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoIBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

<br>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not make any changes to `IBook`, such as `list`, will not call `Model#saveIBookChanges()`. Thus, state change records in `StateChangeRecorder` remain unchanged.

<img src="images/UndoRedoState4.png" width="500" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which again will call `Model#saveIBookChanges()` at the end of its execution. Since the `currentStateChange` is not pointing at the end of the `stateChanges` list, all state changes after the `currentStateChange` will be cleared.

Reason: It does not make sense to redo the `add n:Maggie​ p:200` command. This is the convention that most modern desktop applications follow.

<img src="images/UndoRedoState5.png" width="500" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/SaveChangesActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1:** Save the entire `iBook`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

  &nbsp;

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Methods that make changes to `iBook` have corresponding reverse actions.
  * Pros: Uses less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the product being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each method is correct.
