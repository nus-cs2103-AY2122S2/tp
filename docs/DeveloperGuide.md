### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete class 2`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `*EntityListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

`*EntityListPanel` and `*EntityListCard` represent separate list panels and cards tailored for a specific entity (`Student`, `ClassGroup`, `Module`, `Assessment`).

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays various `Entity` objects residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TAssistParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete class 2")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete class 2` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TAssistParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TAssistParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `TAssistParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the TAssist data i.e., all `Student`, `TaModule`, `ClassGroup`, `Assessment` objects (which are contained in `UniqueStudentList`, `UniqueModuleList`, `UniqueClassGroupList`, `UniqueAssessmentList` objects respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student`/`TaModule`/`ClassGroup`/`Assessment` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>`/`ObservableList<TaModule>`
/`ObservableList<ClassGroup>`/`ObservableList<Assessment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).
* An `Entity` object is a generic object that can be used to represent instances of  `Student`/`TaModule`/`ClassGroup`/`Assessment`.
* Module are named `TaModule` due to conflict with Java classes.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both TAssist data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TAssistStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

###  Add Feature

The add mechanism is facilitated by `TAssist`. Its functionality, usage and behaviour is the same for all entities. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `AddCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the command arguments.
* `AddCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes `ModelManager#addEntity()` with the specified entity.
* `ModelManager#addEntity()`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds the specified entity.

Given below is an example usage scenario for the creation of `Student` object and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** As TAssist comes with initial data, the user should issue a `clear` command to remove all existing data.

</div>

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `TAssist` is already populated with data.

![AddState0](images/AddState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `clear` command to remove all existing data in `TAssist`.

![AddState1](images/AddState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add student` command to add a student to `TAssist`. The `add` command also calls `AddCommandParser#parse()`, which parses the input and returns the index and entity type.
* An example of the `add student` command: `add student id/E0123456 n/John Doe e/johnd@u.nus.edu t/john_doe`

![AddState2](images/AddState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `AddCommand#execute()`, instead a `CommandException` will be thrown and no entity will be added.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddModelSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add command:

<img src="images/AddActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Delete Feature

The delete mechanism is facilitated by `TAssist`. Its functionality, usage and behaviour is the same for all entities. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `DeleteCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the command arguments.
* `DeleteCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes `ModelManager#deleteEntity()` with the specified entity.
* `ModelManager#deleteEntity()`â€‰â€”â€‰Deletes the specified entity.
* `ModelManager#deleteEntity()`â€‰â€”â€‰Deletes the specified entity.

However, when a `TaModule` object is deleted, its associated `ClassGroup` and `Assessment` object(s) are also deleted.

Given below is an example usage scenario using `ClassGroup` objects and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `TAssist` is already populated with data.

![DeleteState0](images/DeleteState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `list class` command to list the class groups in the `TAssist`. The `list` command implementation is detailed below in the List Feature section.

Step 3. The user executes `delete class 2` to delete the 2nd class group in the list which is `c2`. The `delete` command also calls `DeleteCommandParser#parse()`, which parses the input and return the index and entity type.

![DeleteState1](images/DeleteState1.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `DeleteCommand#execute()`, instead a `CommandException` will be thrown and no entities will be deleted.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works:

![DeleteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteModelSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delete command:

<img src="images/DeleteActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### List Feature

The list mechanism is facilitated by `TAssist`. Its functionality, usage and behaviour is the same for all entities. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ListCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the command arguments.
* `ListCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes `ModelManager#updateFiltered<ENTITY_NAME>List()` with the predicate that matches the filtering criteria.
* `ModelManager#updateFiltered<ENTITY_NAME>List()`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates the predicate of the entity list so that only filtered entries will be shown in `TAssist`.

Given below is an example usage scenario using `Student` objects and how the list mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `TAssist` is already populated with data.

![ListState0](images/ListState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `list student c/2` to filter out students from the 2nd class group in the list. The `list` command also calls `ListCommandParser#parse()`, which parses the input and return the entity type as well as the class group index or TA module index to filter by.

![ListState1](images/ListState1.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

![ListActivityDiagram](images/ListActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Enrol Feature

#### Implementation

The enrol mechanism is facilitated by `TAssist`. Its functionality, usage and behaviour is only for student entity. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `EnrolCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the command arguments.
* `EnrolCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes `ModelManager#enrolStudent()` with given student(s) and class group.
* `ModelManager#enrolStudent()`â€‰â€”â€‰Enrols student(s) to a given class group.

Given below is an example usage scenario for the enrolment of a `Student` object to a `ClassGroup` object and how the enrol mechanism behaves at each step.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Assumption:** Valid `Student`, `Module` and `ClassGroup` objects are created beforehand.

</div>

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `TAssist` is already populated with data.

![EnrolState0](images/AddState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `enrol` command to enrol student(s) to a `ClassGroup`. The `enrol` command also calls `EnrolCommandParser#parse()`, which parses the input and returns a successful/unsuccessful output message.
* An example of the `enrol` command: `enrol c/1 s/1`

![EnrolState0](images/EnrolState1.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** <br> 1. Student(s) enrolled to a class group will automatically be linked to the module it belongs to.
<br> 2. If a command fails its execution, it will still call `EnrolCommand#execute()`, and a `CommandException` will be thrown and only the valid student(s) will be enrolled to the given class group.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the enrol operation works:

![EnrolSequenceDiagram](images/EnrolSequenceDiagram.png)

![EnrolModelSequenceDiagram](images/EnrolModelSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EnrolCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an enrol command:

![EnrolActivityDiagram](images/EnrolActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Grading Assessment Feature

#### Implementation

The grading assessment mechanism is facilitated by `TAssist`. Since there are various gradable components, a new entity `Assessment` will benefit the application. This entity will allow tutors to customize what are the different gradable components, from assignments to class participations. Tutors can add, delete and list this entity like the other entities. On top of that, they will be able to grade the assessment, using the `grade` command. The following operations will be implemented for the `grade` command:

* `GradeCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the command arguments.
* `GradeCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes `ModelManager#gradeAssessment()` with the specified assessment, students and the grade they get.
* `ModelManager#gradeAssessment()`â€‰â€”â€‰Grades the students for the specified assessment.

The `Assessment` entity will be tied to a specific module. Hence, when a `TaModule` object is deleted, its associated `Assessment` objects are also deleted.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the grading mechanism behaves at each step.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Assumption:** Valid `Student`, `Module`, `ClassGroup` and `Assessment` objects are created beforehand. `Student` objects are enrolled to the `Module` as well.

</div>

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `TAssist` is already populated with the necessary data.

![GradeState0](images/GradeState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `grade a/1 s/1,2 g/1` command to grade the 1st assessment (`a1`) for the 1st and 2nd students (`s1` and `s2` respectively) enrolled in the module with grade 1 in the `TAssist`. The `grade` command would call the `GradeCommandParser#parse()`, which parses the input and return the assessment to grade, which students to grade and what is the grade the students will get for the assessment.

![GradeState1](images/GradeState1.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will still call `GradeCommand#execute()`, and both valid and invalid grading attempts will be printed out.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the grade operation works:

![GradeSequenceDiagram](images/GradeSequenceDiagram.png)
![GradeSequenceDiagram](images/GradeAssessmentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `GradeCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a grade command:

<img src="images/GradeActivityDiagram.png" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to grade assessments:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create `Assessment` entity and this entity will contain the students attempts.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Duplicate data in storage, and need to ensure data is deleted properly if student/module is deleted.

* **Alternative 2:** Create `Assessment` entity and the `TaModule` entity will contain the student attempts.
    * Pros: All module related data are in one class.
    * Cons: Duplicate data in storage, hard to display assessments attempts.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Mark/Unmark feature

#### Implementation

The mark/unmark mechanism is facilitated by `TAssist`. Its functionality, usage and behaviour is currently exclusive to `StudentAttendance`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `MarkCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the command arguments.
* `MarkCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes `ModelManager#markAttendance()` or `ModelManager#unmarkAttendance` based on a specified class group index and week number.
* `ModelManager#markAttendance()`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates the specified `Lesson` object with a list of `StudentAttendance` objects.

Given below is an example usage scenario using `mark` which illustrates how the mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `TAssist` is already populated with data.

![MarkUnmarkState0](images/MarkUnmarkState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `list class` command to list the class groups in the `TAssist`. The `list` command implementation is detailed below in the List Feature section.

Step 3. The user executes `list student c/1` command to list all the students in the class group with index 1.

Step 4. The user executes `mark c/1 w/1 s/1,2` to mark attendance for a lesson which belongs to a class group with index 1 and occurs in week 1. Students with indexes 1 and 2 are marked as having attended. The `mark` command also calls `MarkCommandParser#parse()`, which parses the input and returns a successful/unsuccessful message.

![MarkUnmarkState1](images/MarkUnmarkState1.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the mark operation works:

![MarkUnmarkSequenceDiagram](images/MarkUnmarkSequenceDiagram.png)
