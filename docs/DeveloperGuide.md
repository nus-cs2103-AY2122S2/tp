## **Introduction**

### Purpose

The purpose of the developer guide is to document a brief overview of the multi-level design architecture of
HustleBook. This allows you to gain a better understanding on the various components that makes HustleBook
and how each component work with one another.

### Who is this for? 

The target audience for this Developer Guide is any user who is interested in understanding the internal logic 
and design architecture of HustleBook. What can you do with this information? 
* Support HustleBook as a developer - develop new features or enhance existing features to support the needs of 
our product users. You can send a PR of your contribution to our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pulls)
* Tweak features to suit your needs - any current users who can modify our codes to tweak certain features to fit their needs. E.g:
You need another attribute to track in the client list. 

### What is HustleBook?

HustleBook (HB) is a desktop app specially catered towards financial advisors for **managing client details and meetings, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, HB can get your client management meetings done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Feel free to read the [User Guide](UserGuide.md) to know more about what HustleBook can do for you!

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete John`.
<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `HustleBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete John")` API call.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `HustleBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `HustleBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)


<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

❗️ IMAGE NEEDS TO BE UPDATED (**Remove caution if image is sufficient**)

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `HustleBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Managing Meetings 

Financial Advisors often need to schedule and reschedule meetings with their clients. On top of that, the meetings
are often cancelled upon. Considering these issues, the implementation of managing meeting need to be quick and easy.
Therefore, a meet command was introduced. Along with prefixes of `d/` and `t/` for date and time of the meeting and 
a prefix `c/` to cancel the meeting. 

Furthermore, we decided to implement scheduling the meeting by name to make our application user-friendly, especially 
for non-technical users. As an enhancement, we also ensured that the meeting does not clash with the existing meetings
scheduled. 

The following activity diagram describes how the meet command determine if it should schedule or cancel the meeting 
with a client in the list. It ensures that either the prefixes `d/` and `t/` or only `c/` prefix is given as input. 

<img src="images/ScheduleMeetingActivityDiagram.png" width="600"/>

The following sequence diagram shows how the logic of meet command of when `meet John Doe d/2022-05-25 t/1000` is executed

<img src="images/ScheduleMeetingSequenceDiagram.png" width="600"/>

To further understand the internal logic of executing `meet John Doe d/2022-05-25 t/1000`, a logic sequence diagram is shown
below. This also highlights the logic of checking for meeting clash before scheduling the meeting into HustleBook.

<img src="images/ScheduleMeetingLogicSequenceDiagram.png" width="600"/>

## Adding optional attributes

The following attributes are optional, hence, their prefix can be omitted when using `add` or `edit` command. 
Clients added without the prefixes mentioned below will be assigned a with a predefined value. 
This predefined value can be modified using the `edit` command.

### Previous date met

Financial advisors need to keep a close bond with their clients. This mean that they would need to meet up with their clients on a 
regular basis. It would be beneficial for them to track when was the last time they met with a specific client.

To cater for this information to be stored, an optional attribute `PrevDateMet` has been implemented. A `PrevDateMet` stores the 
date for each client in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. The `PrevDateMet` attribute uses a prefix `d/` when using the `add` or `edit` command.

### Information

Financial advisors would need to keep track of client's information such as their risk tolerance level, their financial goals and 
schemes they are currently on. 

To cater for this information to be stored, an optional attribute `Info` has been implemented. A `Info` stores the information 
about the client. The `Info` attribute uses a prefix `i/` when using the `add` or `edit` command.

### Salary

Clients handled by financial advisors are usually working adults, earning salary and are capable of paying for the services provided by the financial advisors. Moreover, using the client's salary information, financial advisors can better advise them on the plans and/or services to get. Therefore, it is very beneficial to track clients' salaries.

To cater for this new information to be stored, a new optional attribute, `Salary` has been implemented. A `Salary` exists for each client to store their salary amount. 
This attribute can be added to through the use of the `s/` prefix. The `Salary` attribute can be added to a client through the `add` command as well as modified through the `edit` command.


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Handling default values of `PrevDateMet` and `Info`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Non-null values.
    * Pros: Less likely to face any errors as no null values are used.
    * Cons: Considerations of non-null values as the default value has to make sense for users.

* **Alternative 2:** Use null values are default values.
    * Pros: Easier and faster to implement.
    * Cons: Code wise is more prone to errors and more defensive approach have to be used when handling the new attributes.

**Aspect: Handling default values of `Salary`:**
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Use a new constructor with no parameters, taking predefined value as salary.
    * Pros: Future changes to the predefined value will only need simple and small changes in the constructor.
    * Cons: Now the object has an additional constructor method that needs to be kept track of and updated by the developer if any changes are required.

* **Alternative 2:** Use the existing constructor with String as a parameter, passing in a predefined value as salary.
    * Pros: Through the use of an existing method, a developer needs to keep track of and update only one constructor for that object if any change is required.
    * Cons: If any change is required for the predefined value, a developer needs to search all usages of this method and update those using the predefined value to a new value. This can be time-consuming.
    
### Flagging important clients

The feature is implemented to provide functionality and visual representation of important clients. 
Feature is needed for several user stories involving important clients. A new attribute is thus added to the current 
Person class. Flag command is created to shorten the process of flagging a client, instead of needing to use the edit 
command. 

Additionally, a new prefix, `f/`, can be used in the add and edit command to specify the flag status directly. 
This prefix is optional and can be left out during the creation of a new client contact. 

All new clients will adopt a default `unflagged` state when the flag status is not specified. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `flag`/`unflag` command works:

**[COMING SOON]**

The following activity diagram summarizes how to flag a client.

**[COMING SOON]**

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Ease of use of flag commands:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `flag` and `unflag` split into separate commands. 
    * Pros: More intuitive to use as compared to alternative 2 for any user.
    * Cons: More commands to test and maintain.

* **Alternative 2:** Single `flag` command and use an `f/` prefix to set new flag.
    * Pros: Only one command for both scenarios and fewer tests needed.
    * Cons: Usage is not very intuitive to a user.

### Edit, Delete, Flag, and Meet Command, Using name
This feature is a more intuitive way for users to perform actions on their clients, as they can simply use the names of their clients
to identify them, instead of using their index in the list. There are 2 scenarios that will occur when this feature is used.

#### Scenario 1 (All names in HustleBook are unique, there no clients with similar names)

The following sequence diagram shows how the logic of running `edit/delete/flag/meet NAME [ARGS]`.

#### Scenario 2 (There are clients with similar names)
Assume that the user has 3 clients, named `John Doe`, `John Smith` and `John Willams`.

Running `edit/delete/flag/meet John [ARGS]` will first show a list of clients whose name contains `John`. In this case, 
`John Doe`, `John Smith` and `John Williams` are displayed as a list to the user. The user is then asked to enter the index
of the specific "John" they wish to perform their actions on. If the user gives a valid index (in this case `1, 2 or 3`), then the command is executed.


The following diagram illustrates the logic of the command being run. 
![CommandSimilarNames](images/CommandSimilarNames.png)

From the diagram, after the first command is executed, the user is informed that there are
multiple clients with name `John` and is prompted to input an index. After inputting "1", the function `setIndex` of `EditCommand` is called to
specify the client to edit. The `EditCommand` is then executed normally.

This gives convenience to our users as they would not have to type the full name of the client they want to perform an action on. 
Also, when asking the user for multiple inputs, we need a way to keep track of what the user requested beforehand, so they would not need to type it again. 
The addition of `lastCommand` means that the user does not have to type in the command multiple times.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Typing out the full name of a client:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User can run a command with only a partial name. If there are multiple users with that name, 
    the user will be asked a second time to specify which client they are referring to.
    * Pros: More convenient for user, user does not have to type out the full name of their client.
    * Cons: Logic is more complicated and is more difficult to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** User types out the full name of their client.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Inconveniences the user, especially for clients with very long names


### Sort Command

The `sort` command sorts clients based on the parameter provided by the user input.

The `sort` mechanism is facilitated by `HustleBook`. It is implemented by `SortCommand` that extends `Command` and parsed
by `SortCommandParser`. SortCommand accepts a Comparator<Person> and uses FXCollections.sort to sort
`UniquePersonsList`. The parameters `SortCommand` currently accepts are `name`, `prev`, `salary` and `meeting`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `sort` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs `sort name`. `LogicManager#excute` calls `HustleBookParser#parseCommand`.

Step 2. `HustleBookParser#parseCommand` then passes the user input and calls `SortComandParser#parse`.

Step 3. `SortComandParser#parse` calls `SortCommandParser#parseComparatorForSort` to determine the Comparator
required and returns a `PersonNameComparator` object to `SortComandParser#parse`.

Step 4. `SortComandParser#parse` then returns a `SortCommand` containing `PersonNameComparator` to `LogicManager`.

Step 5.  `LogicManager#execute` executes the `SortCommand` which calls `model#sortPersonListBy` and sorts the
`UniquePersonList` using FXCollections.sort and `PersonNameComparator`.


The following sequence diagram shows how the `sort` command works:

### Undo Command

**Background Information**

Client's information is important for a Financial advisor. Therefore, any unintended or accidental changes to the client's information can cause unnecessary problems. For example, new users can accidentally execute `clear`, causing them to lose all their client information.

To revert their actions, Financial advisors have to use multiple commands, e.g `add`, `edit` etc., together to get back to the original state. This can waste time and resources. Therefore, it is very beneficial to include a `undo` command to help users undo any unintended or accidental command executions and go back to a previous state.

**Class Diagram (Only relevant methods are shown):**

![UndoClassDiagram](images/UndoClassDiagram.png)

The `HustleBookHistory` class facilitates the `undo` command. Throughout the entire programme, there will only be 1 instance of the `HustleBookHistory`, to ensure proper updating and saving of the history regardless of where it is executed. `HustleBookHistory` has a `historyList` and `currStatePointer` variables stored internally.

These are the operations that aid in undoing the HustleBook to a previous state:
* `HustleBookHistory#getInstance()` —  Gets the single instance of the `HustleBookHistory`.
* `HustleBookHistory#update(ReadOnlyHustleBook)` —  Saves the current state of the HustleBook to `historyList`.
* `HustleBookHistory#getPrevState()` —  Returns the previous state of the HustleBook and updates the `currStatePointer` to point to the previous state in the `historyList`.

The `Model` interface has a `Model#undoHustleBook()` method which helps to undo the HustleBook to a previous state.

**Usage Scenario**

This is an example of how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `HustleBookHistory` will be initialized. Through the `update` command, the initial HustleBook state will be saved to the `historyList`, and the `currentStatePointer` will be updated to be pointing to that single HustleBook state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete Alex` command to delete the client named `Alex` in the HustleBook. The `delete` command calls `LogicManager#execute()`, where, after updating the HustleBook `storage`, the `HustleBookHistory#update()` command runs. This causes the modified state of the HustleBook after the `delete Alex` command executes to be saved in the `historyList`, and the `currStatePointer` is shifted to point to the newly inserted HustleBook state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `flag David` to flag this client `David`. The `flag` command also calls `LogicManager#execute()`, causing another modified HustleBook state to be saved into the `historyList`, with the `currStatePointer` updated.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not reach the `Storage` update section in `LogicManager#execute()` and call `HustleBookHistory#update()`. As a result, a new HustleBook state is not created. Hence, this HustleBook state will not be saved into the `historyList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that flagging the client was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoHustleBook()`, which will shift the `currStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and returns this HustleBook state. Through the use of `HustleBook#resetData()`, which reverts HustleBook back to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial HustleBook state, then there are no previous HustleBook states to restore. The `undo` command will display a message indicating that there are no commands left to undo instead of trying to get the previous state.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoHustleBook()`, which shifts the `currStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the HustleBook to that state.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire HustleBook.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
