### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add n/junha p/12341234 g/B1LL e/bill@exmple.com")` API call. The input string is abbreviated to [ADD].

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add 1` Command](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="650" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data abstracted as a `AddressBook` object. i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* `VersionedAddressBook` is a child class of `AddressBook` that stores the change of the `AddressBook` whenever data is changed, for `undo` and `redo` command.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Team` and `Skill` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one object per unique `Team` and `Skill`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Team` or `Skill` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

### SkillSet class
The 'SkillSet' class,
* stores a Set of `Skill`
* is used to manipulate `Skill` objects

### Skill class

The `Skill` class,
* can store an alphanumeric skill name value and an integer ranging from 1 to 100 for skill proficiency value
* is a field of the `Person` class
* is used for sorting by `Skill` proficiency level

![skillClassDiagram](images/SkillDiagram.png)

Given below is an example of how `SkillSet` interacts with the `Skill` class when the `Person` class calls the method
`getSkillProficency(Skill)`

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
### Edit feature
#### Implementation

`EditCommand` is responsible for the `edit` command. `EditCommandParser` provides necessary information to `EditCommand` when creating it through parse method. The information includes `isResetMode`, `EditPersonDescriptor`, and `indices`. `indices` is the reference to the list of `index` in the displayed list in GUI, of the person(s) to be edited. `EditPersonDescriptor` encapsulates how the person(s) should be edited, such as which field(e.g. name) should be changed to what(a new name). `isResetMode` is true if the user declared `o/r` to activate reset mode in command, and false otherwise.

![EditCommandClassDiagram](images/EditCommandClassDiagram.png)

### Team forming feature

#### Implementation

`MakeTeamCommand` which supports this feature is a command which is responsible for two distinct command words: `team` and `unteam`.
With most commands implemented in **HackNet** being responsible for one and only one command word, the `MakeTeamCommand` is an exception due to the similarity between the 2 actions.

![MakeTeamCommand](images/MakeTeamCommandClassDiagram.png)

We have decided that it is preferable to use an enumeration to distinguish the two actions the command can perform, rather than having 2 distinct classes, due to their overlapping implementations.
It is recommended that such a design is used for two commands with similar implementations that perform opposite actions.

#### Execution

Below is a sequence diagram showing the execution path for this command

![MakeTeamCommand](images/MakeTeamSequenceDiagram.png)

By making use of the enumeration `TeamAction`, this command decides its execution path to either add or remove someone from the list of potential teammates.

Similar logic required by the command after (e.g. `model#setPerson`) regardless of the path taken will hence have a single implementation, reducing the risks of having 2 out-of-sync commands.

### Filtering feature

#### Implementation
`FilterSkillCommand` is a command which is responsible for one command word: `filter`.
This command is used to display a list of people who has the skill specified in the command argument.

![FilterSkillCommand](images/FilterSkillCommandClassDiagram.png)

#### Execution

Below is a sequence diagram showing the execution path when this command is entered.
The execution path for this diagram only shows the creation of the `FilterSkillCommand`.
The execution of the command is the same as all other commands (e.g. `Delete` and `Add`).
You may refer to them if you require so.

![FilterSkillCommand](images/FilterSkillSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.


### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.


### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Delete the first line containing `{` in the data file `data/addressbook.json`.
   2. Start the application and exit right after.

    Expected: Data from data file is cleared and contains no entry.

## **Appendix: Effort**

1. Although the `skill` feature was built on AB3's `tag`, there was significant difficulty in implementing it as `tag` only took in 1 argument while `skill` took in 2: `skill name` and `skill proficiency` with both of different types. To add on, `tag` did not contain much interaction with the user but `skill` is used in many of HackNet's features such as `sort` and we had to maintain one unique `skill` for every person and updating it only when the `skill profiency` is different. Further abstraction was also done with the `skill` feature by implementing a `skillset` to contain all `skill`s and allow for other developers to easily interact with `skill` without knowing the implementation.
2. There was much difficulty faced in making the `skill` in HackNet's GUI reflect different colour based on input `skill proficiency`. This is because simply changing the `.fxml` file will not work as it was not possible to obtain the `skill proficiency` values there. After tracing the code and finding where the `Label` was created, methods such as `setTextFill()` did not work too. Finally, with help from the [forum](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S2/forum/issues/225), a fellow student suggested a fix with `setStyle()`.
3. The sorting feature required additional work to make sure it is extensible. Firstly, the `ObservableList` serving as the display list of the application needed to support sorting. However, we could not just change the `FilteredList` into a `SortedList` as filtering still needs to be allowed. After some searching of JavaFX documentations, we managed to wrap the `FilteredList` with the `SortedList`, enabling both sorting and filtering together.
4. It was non-trivial to make use of CSS to implement the potential teammate highlighting box. By looking into specific properties like border-width and border-color, we experimented multiple combinations to create the highlighting to improve user experience.
5. Implementing batch edit was moderately difficult. The job included developing `EditCommandParser` class to detect and understand multiple indices, and to execute batch edit only when there are multiple indices provided. However, expanding the corresponding test cases for `edit` was difficult due to the increasing complexity of `edit` command after batch edit was introduced, as it was responsible for both single and batch edit.
