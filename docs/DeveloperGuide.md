### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes): represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Within the DG, when used, these components will be color coded as such:

`UI`: Green

`Logic` : Blue

`Model` : Red

`Storage` : Yellow

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteClient 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

**API**: [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `ProcedureListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client` and `Procedure` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a Client).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteClient 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteClient 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteClientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` and `Procedure` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Procedure>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Client` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Client` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Procedure (AddProc)

This mechanism is facilitated by the `AddProcCommand`. 
It extends from `Command` and takes in a new `Procedure` and `Index`, which points to the Client that it wishes to add the Procedure to. 
It will interact with `Storage` to store the information about the new Procedure added. 
This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setProcedures()`.

In general, the `addProc` command is a command that takes in a string with a Client index and its relevant specified prefixes and parameters. 
It will indicate new Procedures that Clients have added to their Procedure list. 
If an invalid command (be it by invalid indexes, prefixes, or inputs), the respective errors will be thrown.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `addProc` API call.:

![AddProcCommand](images/AddProcCommand.png)

Step 1: Once the user types in the command, the `LogicManager` will be called to execute it. It will use `AddressBookParser` to parse the user command.

Step 2: This results in a new `Parser` (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddProcCommandParser`) object being constructed.

Step 3: This will result in a new `Procedure` object (based on the user inputs) and a new `Command` object (specifically `AddProcCommand`) being constructed.

Step 4: With this, `LogicManager` will call `AddProcCommand` to execute.

Step 5: Within `AddProcCommand`, it will retrieve the `Client` that needs to be added a new `Procedure` and add the new `Procedure` into its Procedure list.

Step 6: Once the `Client` has been updated to include the new `Procedure`, it will update `ModelManager` with the updated `Client` to reflect this change.

### Delete Procedures from a Client (DeleteProc)

The deleteProc mechanism is facilitated by the `DeleteProcCommandParser` and the `DeleteProcCommand`.
The deleteProc mechanism allows deletion of a `Procedure` from an existing `Client` in the address book through interaction with `Storage`.
The specified `Procedure` is permanently deleted.

The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setClient(clientToEdit, editedClient)`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for `deleteProc`:

![DeleteProcSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteProcSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `deleteProc` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The UI loads when the application starts. The user finds the Procedure to delete.

Step 2: The user then calls `deleteProc 1 1` to delete the first `Procedure` in the Procedure Panel that belongs to the first `Client` in the Client Panel.
Then, the `LogicManager` will be called to execute the command, and the input is parsed by the `AddressBookParser`.

Step 3: This results in the creation of a new `Parser`, specifically the `DeleteProcCommandParser`. This parser process the input 
and returns an instance of a `DeleteProcCommand`.

Step 4: With this, the `LogicManager` will call the `DeleteProcCommand` to execute.

Step 5: Within the execution of the `DeleteProcCommand`, it will retrieve the `Client` that contains the `Procedure` to be deleted. 
Following, it deletes the specific `Procedure` from the list of procedures that belongs to the `Client`, and returns an edited list of `Procedure`.

Step 6: Next, the `procedures` attribute of the `Client` is replaced by the newly-edited list of `Procedure`. This edited list does not contain the
deleted `Procedure`. A copy of the edited `Client` is returned. 

Step 7: This newly-edited `Client` is then saved locally and stored through the `Model#setClient(Client target, Client editedClient)`. 
The `ModelManager` is then eventually updated with the deletion of the `Procedure` and this change is reflected in the Procedure Panel.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Will `deleteProc` permanently delete the `Procedure`?**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes the entire Procedure.
    * Pros: Easy to implement and uses less storage.
    * Cons: Users might find it hard to retrieve pre-existing data of the user.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a deleted status for the `Procedure` and only allow vision of undeleted `Procedure` in the Procedure Panel.
    * Pros: User could easily retrieve deleted data.
    * Cons: Can get storage-expensive, which makes future operations slower.

### Edit a Procedure from a Client (EditProc)

The editProc mechanism is facilitated by the `EditProcCommandParser` and the `EditProcCommand`.
The editProc mechanism allows editing of a `Procedure` from an existing `Client` in the address book.
The existing data of the Procedure is permanently overwritten and the new `Procedure` will be stored locally after.
The specified `Procedure` is permanently overwritten.

* The `editClientProcedure(Client clientToEdit)` operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setClient(Client target, Client editedClient)`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for `editProc`:

![EditProcSequenceDiagram](images/EditProcSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `editProc` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: UI loads when the application starts. The user finds the Procedure to edit.

Step 2: The user then calls `editProc 1 1 c/25` to edit the `Cost` of the first `Procedure` in the Procedure Panel that belongs to the first `Client` in the Client Panel.
Then, the `LogicManager` will be called to execute the command, which will be parsed by the `AddressBookParser`.

Step 3: This results in the creation of a new `Parser`, specifically the `EditProcCommandParser`. This parser processes the input
and returns an instance of an `EditProcCommand`.

Step 4: With this, the `LogicManager` will call the `EditProcCommand` to execute.

Step 5: Within the execution of the `EditProcCommand`, it will retrieve the `Client` that contains the `Procedure` to be edited.
Following, it creates a new `Procedure` with the `Cost` attribute edited and the other attributes remaining the same. 

Step 6: Next, the `Procedure` at the specified procedure index in the client's `procedures` attribute is replaced by the newly-created `Procedure`. 
A copy of the edited `Client` is returned.

Step 7: This newly-edited `Client` is saved locally and stored through the `Model#setClient`.
The `ModelManager` is then eventually updated with the edited `Procedure` and this change is reflected in the Procedure Panel.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Will `editProc` permanently overwrite pre-existing data?**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Complete overwrite the pre-existing data.
    * Pros: Easy to implement and uses less storage.
    * Cons: Users might find it hard to retrieve pre-existing data of the user.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a new model that saves important information of the pre-existing data.
    * Pros: User could easily retrieve previous overwritten data.
    * Cons: Can get storage-expensive, which makes future parsing slower.

### List Procedures By Client (ListProc)

Lists the Procedures for the given input index of a Client.

If the Client doesn't have any Procedures, it prints out a different message indicating that. Otherwise, it will simply
print out the success message on result window and update the right column of the UI.

Below is the sequence diagram for executing ListProcCommand as a user.
![ListProcCommand Sequence Diagram](images/ListProcCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1: UI starts when the application starts.

Step 2: User calls the "listProc 1" command

Step 3: LogicManager handles the command from user

Step 4: ModelManager updates the Procedure list accordingly and returns to LogicManager

Step 5: UI takes the return value from LogicManager and updates the UI

**Design Considerations**

With other commands like find, an explicit UI update was not necessary based on the AB-3 codebase.
However, even when updating the Procedure list correctly didn't trigger the UI update, which was a serious problem. 
The updateFilteredClients method only applies filters to an already existing set of Clients, but
Unlike the list of Clients, Procedures will change drastically from Client to Client. Therefore,
the solution that was to update the actual Procedure list first and then call updateFilteredProcedures to
update the Procedure list; this successfully solved the problem.

> :question: Why is listProc command is called in the UI before any user input?
> 
> :bulb: This displays the first Client's Procedures so that the user can understand
> what the right column is for.

### List Procedures By Date (ListProcOn)

#### Implementation

`ListProcOn` command takes in a date (in the form of dd/mm/yyyy) and returns the Procedures and the Clients' information attached to each of the Procedure that a technician should carry out on that requested date. <br/><br/>
Like other Commands, user input is first parsed by `AddressBookParser`, which is then directed to `ListProcOnCommandParser`, parsing the date into `DateWithoutTime` class, and finally passing down to `ListProcOnCommand` for execution.
Description of `DateWithoutTime` shall be omitted here since the class name is self-explanatory. The below simplified class diagram illustrates such dependencies. <br/>

<img src="images/ListProcOnCommandClassDiagram.png" width="200" />

`ListProcOnCommand` will then be executed, returning `CommandResult` that can be displayed to the users. The following sequence diagram illustrates the execution of `ListProcOnCommand`.

<img src="images/ListProcOnCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="650" />

In short, the command will ask for all the Clients list from the `Model`, and each Client is responsible for returning Procedures that is scheduled on `targetDate`.
`ListProcOnCommand` adds them up together and returns `CommandResult` for subsequent UI operations.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to connect each Procedure to its associated Client:** <br/>
This aspect needs to be considered since it is not sufficient just to display all the Procedures for a given date; the user must know about the Procedure's associated Client as well for the feature to be useful.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses a `Pair` container to contain both Procedure and its associated Client when aggregating.
    * Pros: No need to create an additional attribute for Procedure connecting to its associated Client.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage, as `ListProcOnCommand` needs to save both the Procedure and its associated Client.

* **Alternative 2:** Attach an attribute to a Procedure that points to its associated Client class.
    * Pros: Easy to implement. (Simply an additional line of code)
    * Cons: Cost-related issues (e.g. time consumed for additional integration tests between Procedure and Client, as well as changes to existing tests and sample data)

### Calculate Cost By Date (Calculate)

It gives functionality to the cost attribute within the Procedure class by calculating total `Cost` from all Procedures on a specified date.
This provides an instance of total `Cost`, which is not stored locally.
It implements the following operation:

`Networkers#calculateCost(String date)`â€‰â€”â€‰returns total `Cost` from all Procedures on a specified date.

The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#calculateCost()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the calculateCost feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user would already have Procedures attributed to different Clients in `Networkers`
and would want to calculate all the costs of Procedures conducted today (22/03/2022)

![CalculateCostObjectDiagram](images/CalculateCostState1.png)

Step 2. The user executes `calculate 22/03/2022` to calculate cost of all Procedures on `22/03/2022`.

The following sequence diagram shows how this operation works:

Firstly, the users input is parsed by the AddressBookParser and the CalculateCommandParser 
and a CalculateCommand with the specified date is returned to the logic manager.

![CalculateSequenceDiagram](images/calculatepart1.png)

Next, the logicManager, calls the calculateCommand's execute() method. 
For each client in the lastshownlist, if the client contains procedures on the specified date,
it will be added to the totalCost variable.

Finally, the totalCost variable is passed to command result in order to return
the appropriate output.

![CalculateSequenceDiagram](images/calculatepart2.png)

:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `CalculateCommandParser` and `CalculateCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X)
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

1. The arguments passed to the logic manager will be parsed by the AddressBookParser class.
2. If the given arguments are valid, further parsing will be carried out by the CalculateCommandParser.
3. If further parsing is successful, a new CalculateCommand object will be returned

A valid argument consists of 2 sections:
1. valid command `calculate`
2. valid date, `22/03/2022`


A date is only valid if it satisfies the isValidDate() method defined in the DateWithoutTime Class

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Has a need to manage a significant number of businesses (Client(s))
* Has a need to manage different network-related Procedures for his/her Client(s), such as maintaining and repairing network components like routers and modems
*  Prefers desktop apps over other types
*  Can type fast
*  Prefers typing to mouse interactions
*  Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:
* Manage Clients and the respective Procedures faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
* Keep important information regarding the userâ€™s business in one platform to manage Clients and past, current, and future Procedures more easily

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    1. Double-click the jar file 
       Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. Checking initially displayed Procedures
   
    1. Check if the procedures are from the first Client.<br>
       Expected: The displayed Procedures should all be from client at index 1.

### Deleting a Client

1. Deleting a Client while all Clients are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all Clients using the `list` command. Multiple Clients in the list.

    1. Test case: `deleteClient 1`<br>
       Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

    1. Test case: `deleteClient 0`<br>
       Expected: No Client is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

    1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `deleteClient`, `deleteClient x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.
       
### Saving data

1. Checking if data saves and loads correctly

    1. Launch application.
    2. Delete a Client and close the window.
    3. Launch application again and check if the Client is deleted <br>
        Expected: the deleted Client is not in the list anymore 
       
1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

    1. Delete the networkers.json in data folder and launch the application <br>
    Expected: the networkers.json should be created on launch
    2. To simulate a corrupted data file, change the value of a field of a Client or a Procedure to a non-String value. Then, launch the application. <br>
    Expected: The networkers.json opens but does not load any Clients and Procedures with an error message in the log.
