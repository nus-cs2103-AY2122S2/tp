### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component 
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside components being coupled to the 
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EntryListPanel`, 
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which 
captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` has 3 different `ListPanel` components: `PersonList`, `CompanyList`, and `EventList`. Only one of these lists
are shown at a time in the display.

Notice as the application only shows one list at one time, `EntryListPanel` acts as a placeholder to contain
`PersonListPanel`, `CompanyListPanel`, or `EventListPanel`.

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person`, `Company`, and `Event` objects
residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` 
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a 
placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
 the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as 
a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`, `ListPersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface
so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Entry` objects 
  * Each type of entry (`Company`, `Person`, and `Event`) is contained in their own `UniqueEntryList` objects.
* stores the currently 'selected' objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list.
  * Each type of entry (`Company`, `Person`, and `Event`) has their own filtered list
  * These filtered lists are exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entry>` that can be 'observed' 
e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
`ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain,
they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

Here are the various classes that inherits from and is used by the `Entry` object:

<img src="images/EntryClasses.png" width="650" />

Note that the `CompanyName` object is actually just a `Name` object, so in effect `Person` and `Event` have two
`Name` objects: one for their name, and one for the name of the company they are attached to.

Furthermore, the `CompanyName`
object must match an existing `Company` object in the `AddressBook`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model
is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Entry` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only 
require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Entry` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `addc n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `addc` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `listc`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `listc`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `addc n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Archive Feature

#### Design

The main idea of the archive feature for InternBuddy is that archived entries will not show up when searching for entries
with the `find` or `list` or `sort` commands unless the user specifies that they specifically want to search for archived entries.
In this way, they function similarly to hidden files in many file managers.

To handle this, the `list`, `find` and `sort` commands needed an extra parameter indicating the search type. For flexibility,
there were 3 kinds of search types: `UNARCHIVED_ONLY`, `ARCHIVED_ONLY`, and `ALL`. The user could still opt
not to explicitly pass a search type; in this case, the default behavior would be `UNARCHIVED_ONLY`.

This extra parameter required the list commands, which previously had no parser, to use a `ListCommandParser` in order
to parse the needed search type. Because the parser would function almost the same for each of the list commands, only one
`ListCommandParser` object was created to handle the 3 kinds of list commands. This itself necessitated creating a
`ListCommand` object class that each of the 3 list command classes would inherit from, so that the `ListCommandParser`
could return any of the 3 list command classes for the `parse()` method.

To deal with the actual archiving, each `Entry` object was given an `isArchived` attribute indicating if the entry
was archived or not. Predicates to check the value of the `isArchived` attribute of each entry could then be applied to the
filtered lists to filter out archived entries (or filter only archived entries).

Finally, the `archive` command was designed to take only the index as the parameter. It would archive the entry specified
by the index that was in the currently displayed list. The `unarchive` command has a similar design.

#### Implementation

For the `archive` command:
1. The user executes `archive 3`.
2. This command is parsed to check if the given index is valid. If not, a `ParseException` is thrown.
3. Otherwise, the created `ArchiveCommand` object will execute `Model#archiveEntry(index, true)`.
4. The model will then retrieve the object from the currently displayed filtered list based on the `index` given and pass
this along with the boolean argument to`ReadOnlyAddressBook#setArchiveEvent()` (or `setArchiveCompany()` or `setArchivePerson()`) depending on
the value of `currentlyDisplayedListType`
5. The address book will then call `setArchiveEntry(object, true)` in the respective `UniqueEntryList`.
6. Finally, the `UniqueEntryList` will search for the passed object and if it exists (which it should unless a bug occurs),
it will call the `setArchived(true)` of the Entry.
7. Finally, the command calls `Model#updateCurrentlyDisplayedList(PREDICATE_SHOW_UNARCHIVED_ONLY)` to change the currently
displayed list to show all its unarchived entries. Note that in order to get the update to work properly,
`Model#updateCurrentlyDisplayedList(PREDICATE_ALL) must be called first.
8. The `CommandResult` of the `archive` command is returned.

A similar process is performed with the `unarchive` command, but `Entry#setArchived()` is ultimately passed `false` instead of `true`.

For one of the list commands, here is a sample process:
1. The user executes `listc`
2. The `ListCommandParser` object is creates with the appropriate `ListType` passed as a parameter to the constructor.
3. The `ListCommandParser` parses the command to see if the search type parameter is valid. If there is none, or if the
passed search type parameter is `unarchived`, `archived`, or `all`, the execution proceeds to 3). Otherwise, a
`ParseException` is thrown.
4. The `ListCommandParser` then creates the appropriate `ListCommand` object based on the `ListType` attribute. The
`ListCommand` object is created with a `SearchType` passed as the parameter.
5. When the `ListCommand` object is executed, it switches the displayed list to the proper one and applies the appropriate
predicate on it depending on the search type.
6. The `CommandResult` of the `find` command is returned.

A simplified sequence diagram of the archive command is shown below.

![ArchiveSequenceDiagram](images/ArchiveSequenceDiagram.png)

### Sort Feature

#### Design

The main idea for the sort feature for InternBuddy is that entries can be sorted by the importance of the entry. In InternBuddy, the importance of a company or a person is based on the lexicographical order of the company or person's name. As for event, the importance of an event is based on the date of the event. The sort feature is capable of ordering the entries in ascending or descending order.

The `sort` command functions similarly to its `list` counterpart in terms of display. Both the commands will display the entries accordingly depending on the entry type specified for the command. The difference is that the `sort` command will sort the entries according to the importance of the entry.

Due to its similar nature to the `list` command, the `sort` command extends the `list` command to minimize re-implementing the same behaviour twice. This is also done to further enforce DRY. The `sort` command also has a `SearchType` parameter. The `SearchType` parameter is optional. The `sort` command takes in an additional `Ordering` parameter as well. The `Ordering` parameter is optional. the `Ordering` parameter allows the user to specify whether the entries should be sorted in ascending or descending order.

Since `sort` is a newly implemented feature, a new parser `SortCommandParser`. Similar to its `list` counterpart, `SortCommandParser` will handle the creation of the 3 kinds of sort commands. Similar to above, the `SortCommandParser` will also handle the parsing of the `SearchType` and `Ordering` parameters. Now the `parse()` method can return any of the 3 sort commands.

To handle the actual sorting, the `SortCommand` will call `Model#sortPersonListByName`/ `Model#sortCompanyListByName`/ `Model#sortEventListByDate` to sort the entries. Each respective call of sort methods in the model calls the same respective method in addressbook.

Please take note that the `SortCommand` does not just sort the displayed list (`FilteredList`), it also sorts the actual stored list (`UniqueEntryList`). This is to ensure that the order of the list persists even after the user has sorted the list (i.e. calling a `find` or `list` command).

#### Common Implementation
Note that we are going to use XYZ as a placeholder of either Company, Event, or Person for this section.

For the `sortXYZ` command: (where `XYZ` is `person`, `company`, or `event`)
1. The user executes `sortXYZ o/descending`.
2. This command is parsed to check if the given optional parameters are there and valid (`o/ORDERING` and `s/SEARCH_TYPE`). If not, a `ParseException` is thrown. In this case, the `Ordering` parameter is set to `DESCENDING` (since `o/descending` is specified, otherwise set to `ASCENDING`) and the `SearchType` parameter is set to `UNARCHIVED` (default value of the optional parameter).
3. Otherwise, the created `SortXYZCommand` object will execute `Model#sortPersonListByName`/ `Model#sortCompanyListByName`/ `Model#sortEventListByDate` depending on `XYZ`.  These methods take 2 parameters: the first is the `Predicate` and the second is the `Ordering`. `Predicate` is generated by the command through the `SearchType` parameter.
4. The model will then call the respective sort method in the address book (i.e. `AddressBook#sortPersonListByName`/ `AddressBook#sortCompanyListByName`/ `AddressBook#sortEventListByDate`). These methods in address book requires 1 parameter, which is the `Comparator<? super XYZ>` object to be used for sorting. The Comparator needed is already predefined in the model.
5. The address book will then call `sort(Comparator<? super XYZ>)` in the respective `UniqueEntryList`.
6. Finally, the `UniqueEntryList` will sort the entries according to the `Comparator` object passed in.
7. Finally, moving to the model again, the `Model#showXYZList(predicate)` method is called to display the list. The `predicate` is generated by the command through the `SearchType` parameter.
8. The `CommandResult` of the `sortXYZ` command is returned.

A similar process is performed with the `unarchive` command, but `Entry#setArchived()` is ultimately passed `false` instead of `true`.

### Adding Feature

#### Design

Adding an Entry whether it is Company, Person, or Event is essential for InternBuddy. In particular, it is one of the 
most important features to make InternBuddy working. However, notice that each entry has different attributes which
can be tricky to implement.

The command designs for each type of entries must be similar to make sure that the code is united and coherent. In particular, 
although the implementation of `addc`, `addp`, and `adde` commands are similar, it is necessary to divide them out to their own classes.

While the design of each `add` command is inspired from AB3, there are quite some changes to the implementation as `Event`, `Company`,
and `Person` have different attributes. In particular, there are now 3 `UniqueEntryList` for each `Entry`. This is to make sure that the three different `Entry`
does not mix with each other when displaying in `UI`.


#### Common Implementation
Note that we are going to use XYZ as a placeholder of either Company, Event, or Person for this section.

The Activity Diagram below summarizes what happens when the user enters the add command
<img src="images/AddXYZActivityDiagram.png" />


For the `addXYZ` command:
1. The user executes `addXYZ` followed by `XYZ` parameters (along with their tags). You can look at our UG to see the parameters.
2. This command is parsed by `AddXYZCommandParser` to check if the given parameters are valid. If not, a `ParseException` is thrown.
3. Otherwise, an `XYZ` object is created and `AddXYZCommand` object will be created accordingly.
4. Next, `AddXYZCommand` will check whether the added `XYZ` object exists in the address book by using `Model#hasEntry()`.
   if the added `XYZ` object is a duplicate, then `CommandException` will be thrown. 
5. Otherwise, the created `AddXYZCommand` object will call `Model#addXYZ()` to add `XYZ` object to the model.
   1. Next, the model will call `AddressBook#addXYZ()`
   2. Note that in the address book, there is a `UniqueEntryList<XYZ>` which hold all the companies in the address book.
      The added `XYZ` object will be added to the list in this function.
   3. Finally, the model will call `updateFilteredXYZList()` to set the display list to be the `XYZ` list.
6. The `CommandResult` of the `XYZ` command is returned.

Here is the Sequence Diagram for the implementation to understand it better. The Sequence Diagram will be a simplified version
of the actual implementation to show the important sections.
![AddXYZSequenceDiagram](images/AddXYZSequenceDiagram.png)

In the diagram, `addXYZexample` is just a placeholder for user input. You can look at the UG for sample user input for different
add commands.

#### Specific Implementation

1. When adding a company, InternBuddy has to make sure that no other company of the same name has been added. This is to
prevent users from adding multiple redundant duplicates of companies, which is also one of our design decision to improve
user experience.
   1. `check(xyz)` in the diagram will contain `hasCompany(xyz)`

![AddCompanySequenceDiagram1](images/AddCompanySequenceDiagram1.png)

2. When adding a person, InternBuddy has to make sure that no other person of the same name has been added. This is to
prevent users from adding multiple redundant duplicates of companies, which is also one of our design decision to improve
user experience.
   1. `check(xyz)` in the diagram will contain `hasPerson(xyz)` and `hasCompany(xyz.getCompanyName)`

![AddPersonSequenceDiagram1](images/AddPersonSequenceDiagram1.png)

3. Finally, when adding an event, InternBuddy has to make sure that no other event has the same combination of (name, companyName, date, and time).
This is because we notice that multiple events with the same name should be valid as event's names are more general. Therefore, we consider
more attributes when judging whether two events are the same entry.
   1. `check(xyz)` in the diagram will contain `hasEvent(xyz)` and `hasEvent(xyz.getCompanyName)`
   
![AddEventSequenceDiagram1](images/AddEventSequenceDiagram1.png)

### Finding Feature

#### Design
This feature allows the user to display selected `Entry` in the address book. It is facilitated by `ModelManager`. This acts as a way for user to 
filter the entries by their attributes.

While the design of each `find` command is inspired from AB3, there are quite some changes to the implementation as `Event`, `Company`,
and `Person` have different attributes. As mentioned, there are now 3 `UniqueEntryList` for each `Entry`. Each command will look at different
`UniqueEntryList` accordingly.

To understand how each `find` commands work in depth. Look at `CompanyContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate`, and `EventContainsKeywordsPredicate` classes
which are the main logic when filtering each `Entry`.

The Activity Diagram below summarizes what happens when the user enters the add command
<img src="images/FindXYZActivityDiagram.png" />

#### Common Implementation
Note that we are going to use XYZ as a placeholder of either Company, Event, or Person for this section.

For the `findXYZ` command:
1. The user executes `findXYZ` followed by `XYZ` parameters (along with their tags). You can look at the parameters in our UG.
2. This command is parsed by `FindXYZCommandParser` to check if the given parameters are valid. If not, a `ParseException` is thrown.
3. Otherwise, `XYZContainsKeywordsPredicate` object will be created. Note that `XYZContainsKeywordsPredicate` is the class responsible to test
   whether a particular `XYZ` object fits the queried entry. With this predicate, `FindXYZCommand` object will be created.
4. Next, `FindXYZCommand` will call `Model#showXYZList(predicate)`.
   1. The model will update the displayed list to be the `XYZ` list and choose only the `XYZ` objects that suits the query
      using `XYZContainsKeywordsPredicat#test()'.
6. The `CommandResult` of the `XYZ` command is returned.

Here is the Sequence Diagram for the implementation to understand it better.
![FindXYZSequenceDiagram](images/FindXYZSequenceDiagram.png)

In the diagram, `FindXYZexample` is just a placeholder for user input. You can look at the UG for sample user input for different
find commands.

### Editing Feature

The design and implementation of `edit` commands are similar to `find` commands and their sequence diagrams differ minimally.
For developers, you can trace through the code similarly with the `find` commands.

### List Feature

#### Design
This feature allows the user to display unarchived, archived, or all the `Entry` in the address book. It is facilitated by `ModelManager`. This acts as a way for user to display entries in the most general way (respective to the desired entry type).

As entries can either be archived or unarchived, the parameter `SearchType` can be passed to the `list` command to indicate which entries to display.

#### Common Implementation
Note that we are going to use XYZ as a placeholder of either Company, Event, or Person for this section.

For the `listXYZ` command:
1. The user executes `listXYZ` followed by `SearchType` parameters.
2. This command is parsed by `ListXYZCommandParser` to check if the given parameters are valid. If not, a `ParseException` is thrown.
3. Otherwise, `ListXYZCommand` object will be created.
4. Next, `ListXYZCommand` will call `Model#showXYZList(Predicate)` (`Predicate` is generated by `ListXYZCommand` through `SearchType`).

## **Appendix: Effort**

**Difficulty Level**: Medium

**Effort Required**: Around the effort level required for AB3

**Challenges Faced**:
* implementing the commands to work for all 3 types of entries
* implementing the commands to work with different attributes of different entries.
* extending and refactoring existing architecture to work for all 3 types of entries
* maintaining OOP design and keeping dependencies and code reuse to a minimum
* adding multiple new features that didn't have an existing framework in AB3 originally, such as Archive and Sorting
* finding bugs and writing automated tests for all the new features
* maintaining the property that all `Event` and `Person` objects must refer to a `Company` object - even through editing and deletion
* updating the UI to give it a new look as well as handle the new entries

**Achievements of the Project**:
* enhanced the original AB3 project with all new features, such as Archiving and Sorting
* updated AB3 to support `Companies` and `Events` along with the original `Persons`, including updating all existing commands
 to handle each type of entry
* added many Quality-of-Life commands to improve use, such as a command to delete all entries in a list and being able
  to find entries by attributes other than the name
* upgrading all the commands to more intuitive command
* updating the UI with better colour design to make the application prettier.
* did all of the above while keeping the project OOP, clean, and extendable
