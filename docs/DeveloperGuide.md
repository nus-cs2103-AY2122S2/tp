## 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

## 3.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

The `Graphical UI` that will be displayed to the users when using `UniGenda` is as follows:

![UI Explanation](images/UiWithExplanation.png)

## 3.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

## 3.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects along with their `Schedule` and other attributes (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 3.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

## 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

# 4. **Implementation Highlights**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

## 4.1 Schedule Feature
This subsection details how `Schedule` and `Event` classes were implemented.

### Implementation
To enable users to track their contacts' schedules, 2 new classes have been added: `Schedule` and `Event`
* Each `Person` has a `Schedule` attribute.
* A `Schedule` contains a list of `Event`s.
* An `Event` has an `EventDescription`, a `LocalDate`, a `LocalTime`, a `Duration` and a `RecurFrequency`.
  * Here, the `RecurFrequency` indicates how often the `Event` occurs, which can be daily, weekly, biweekly or none.

<img src="images/ScheduleClassDiagram.png" width="500" />

The start date of recurring events are updated upon the start-up of the application, to reflect the next occurrence of the event, if the event has already passed.

### Design considerations
**Aspect: How should we differentiate recurring events and non-recurring events?**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Every `Event` has a `RecurFrequency` attribute. `RecurFrequency` has a `None` value to represent non-recurring tasks.
  * Pros:
    * Easier to implement, no need to deal with Jackson library deciphering whether data should be recurring or non-recurring type.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* **Alternative 2:** Have a `RecurringEvent` class inherit from `Event` and only `RecurringEvent`s should have the `RecurFrequency` attribute.
  * Pros: 
    * Slightly more OOP.
  * Cons:
    * Difficult to implement, increases likelihood of bugs and may take more time to implement should we misunderstand how Jackson library deciphers data.
    * More awkward type checking and casting when checking for recurrence.

**Aspect: How should we implement event's date, time and duration attributes?**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use Java's in built LocalDate, LocalTime and Duration classes.
  * Pros:
    * Easier to implement, no need to account for leap years, number of days in a month, formatting etc. Also has inbuilt support to calculate time.
* **Alternative 2:** Create our own Date, Time and Duration classes.
  * Pros: 
    * More customisable.
  * Cons:
    * Higher possibility of bugs if we do not properly account for leap years, number of days in a month, formatting etc. Will also take too much time to implement.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4.2 WhoIsFree feature
This subsection details how the `whoIsFree` command is implemented. This command allows the user to find persons who are free at the specified time and date. Persons who are free will be listed in the person list.

### Implementation
`WhoIsFreeCommandParser` and `WhoIsFreeCommand` classes are involved in the execution of the `whoIsFree` command.

The `parse` method of `WhoIsFreeCommandParser` receives the user input and extracts the required arguments. It then creates a predicate object that will help check if the user's contacts' schedule coincides with the specified time and date.

A successful execution of the `whoIsFree` command is described as follows:

1. `WhoIsFreeCommand` uses the predicate prepared during parsing to filter the list of persons in `Model`.
2. A `CommandResult` with the number of persons free is returned. A list of persons who are free will also be displayed to the user.

![WhoIsFreeSequenceDiagram](images/WhoIsFreeSequenceDiagram.png)

### Design Considerations
**Aspect: Should we allow dates that have already passed?**
* **Alternative 1 (current implementation)**: Ignore dates that have passed.
  * Pros:
    * Prevents users from expecting the wrong results when recurring events are involved.
  * Cons:
    * Harder implementation as we would have to consider all events with respect to today.
* **Alternative 2**: Treat the past dates as a normal dates.
  * Pros:
    * Easy implementation as there is nothing special to take note.
  * Cons:
    * Does not make sense to check dates have already passed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Aspect: What to do with persons who do not have a schedule?**
* **Alternative 1 (current implementation)**: Persons without schedule are always free.
  * Pros:
    * Easy implementation.
  * Cons:
    * Persons without schedule may not be free at the specified date and time.
    * We will have to check all persons for their schedule and display all persons.
* **Alternative 2**: Persons without schedule are always busy.
  * Pros:
    * Higher certainty that persons shown will be free.
    * Less information to process as we ignore persons without schedule.
  * Cons:
    * Persons without schedule may be free at the specified date and time.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4.3 ViewSchedule Feature

This subsection details how the `viewSchedule` feature is implemented. This command allows user to view a specified person's schedule.

### Implementation

To allow users to view their contact's schedules, we implemented a `ViewScheduleCommand`, and added a `FilteredList<Person>` object in `ModelManager` to facilitate its execution. Moreover, we created `ScheduleCard.java`, `ScheduleCardPanel.java`, and their respective `.fxml` files.

Overall, how this command works is similar to a combination of `delete` and `find`, in which we only take an index as input, and we retrieve information based on the filtered list.

To **view** a person's schedule, the user needs to run the `viewSchedule` command.
The parsing of the viewSchedule command is handled by the following classes:
* `AddressBookParser`
    * Checks that the user input contains the ViewScheduleCommand.COMMAND_WORD and calls `ViewScheduleCommandParser#parse()`.
* `ViewScheduleCommandParser`
    * Parses the user input to create an `Index` of the person to view.
    * Returns a `ViewScheduleCommand` to be executed by the `LogicManager`.
    * In case of invalid index, it will be handled by the `ViewScheduleCommand` upon execution.

A successful execution of the `viewSchedule` command is described as follows:
1. The `ViewScheduleCommand` retrieves the currently listed `Person`'s from the `Model`.
2. The `personToView` is obtained from the above list using the `Index` created during the parsing of the viewSchedule command.
3. `ViewScheduleCommand` creates a new `SamePersonPredicate` that returns `True` only if the tested `Person` equals to `personToView`.
4. `ViewScheduleCommand` updates the `Model`'s `viewedPerson` (the `FilteredList<Person>` object) by parsing in the `SamePersonPredicate`.
5. `ViewScheduleCommand` constructs the `CommandResult` and returns it to the `LogicManager`.
6. The GUI will be updated accordingly.

<img src="images/ViewScheduleSequenceDiagram.png" />

### Design Considerations
**Aspect: Should viewedPerson be a FilteredList or a Person?**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** viewedPerson as a FilteredList.
  * Pros:
    * Easier to implement, easier to develop if in the future we want to display more than one Person.
  * Cons:
    * Not intuitive since now the viewSchedule command only support viewing one Person.
* **Alternative 2:** viewedPerson as a Person.
  * Pros:
    * More intuitive because it **is** the displayed Person's Schedule we are interested in.
  * Cons:
    * Can only view one Person at any time, need to change the implementation when developer wants to display more than one Person.

**Aspect: What attributes should be displayed in the schedule panel upon calling viewSchedule?**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displays Name, Tags, and Schedule; No Schedule on Person List.
  * Pros:
    * Cleaner look of Person List, can display more detailed version of Events.
  * Cons:
    * User doesn't know if a particular Person in the Person List has any Schedule or not.
* **Alternative 2:** All attributes of a Person both on Schedule and Person List.
  * Pros:
    * More detailed version of a Person, so the user doesn't need to look in both panels to get all the information of a Person.
  * Cons:
    * Person List display only fits a few Persons at a time.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4.4 ViewGroup Feature
This subsection details how the `viewGroup` command is implemented. This command allows the user to be able to view a list of persons who share the same tag.

### Implementation
`ViewGroupCommandParser` and `ViewGroupCommand` classes are involved in the execution of the `ViewGroup` command.

The `parse` method of `ViewGroupCommandParser` received the user input and extracts the required arguments. It then creates a predicate object that will help check if the contact has the user-inputted tag attached to the contact.

A successful execution of the `viewGroup` command is described as follows:

1. `ViewGroupCommand` uses the predicate prepared during parsing to filter the list of persons in `Model`

2. A `CommandResult` with the number of persons who share the same tag is returned. A list of persons who share the same tag will also be displayed to the user.

<img src="images/ViewGroupSequenceDiagram.png" />

### Design Considerations

**Aspect: What is an attribute of a person that a user would want to filter contacts by?**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filter by tag
  * Pros: 
    * People who share the same tag are likely to be from the same group of friends, hence a user would be able to view the details or schedule of those persons more easily using such a command.
  * Cons:
    * Not able to filter by another attribute of a person such as whether person has schedule or not.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* **Alternative 2:** Filter by whether person has schedule or not.
  * Pros: 
    * It allows the user to view the contacts whom they have added their schedule to. These persons can be assumed to be closer to the user as the user has added a schedule to them, hence a user is more likely to plan a meetup with such contacts.
  * Cons: 
    * Ultimately, a tag is still the best way for users to distinguish between groups of friends and had this implementation been enforced, users would not have been allowed to filter contacts by tag.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4.5 FindCommonTiming Feature
This subsection details how the findCommonTiming feature is implemented. This command allows user to find common timings for a group of persons in their address book.

### Implementation
`FindCommonTimingParser`, `FindCommonTimingCommand` and `IsTagInPersonPredicate` classes are involved in the execution of the `findCommonTiming` command.

The `parse` method of `FindCommonTimingCommandParser` receives the user input and extracts the required arguments. It then creates a predicate object that will help check if the contact has the user-inputted tag attached to the contact. The user-inputted date will be used to retrieve events occuring on the same day such that the free timings can be determined. 

A successful execuction of the `findCommonTiming` command is described as follows:

1. `FindCommonTimingCommand` uses the predicate prepared during parsing to filter the list of persons in `Model`.
2. Events occuring on a certain day are then retrieved using the `getEventsAtDate` function.
3. The day will be represented as an array of 48 time slots, with each element of the array representing a 30-minute timeslot.
4. TheThe `blockTimeSlots` function is used to ensure that respective timeslots are set as busy according to when events occur.
5. Free time slots will be appended to a string that is due to be returned in the `CommandResult`.
6. A `CommandResult` with the timeslots that the persons are free will be returned (timeslots are in intervals of 30 minutes). 
These timeslots will then be displayed to the user.

<img src="images/FindCommonTimingSequenceDiagram.png" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How FindCommonTiming executes**
* **Alternative 1(current implementation)**: Partition the day into time blocks in an array. For every event that belongs to a person with the specified tag, get the start and end times of the event and block the relevant time blocks between the 2 timings to indicate that at least 1 person is unavailable during the time blocks. At the end, return the time blocks that have not been blocked.
  * Pros:
    * The method is easier to grasp and has less edge cases that need to be handled.
  * Cons:
    * To print out free timings, a lot of effort is required to ensure timings that are printed out are bug-free.

* **Alternative 2**: Create a new TimeSlot class that has a start time and a duration attribute. Create an array containing 1 TimeSlot object with a start time of 00:00 and duration of 24 hours to represent the day. For every event that belongs to a person with the specified tag, get the start and end times of the event and split the TimeSlot object to "remove" the timeslots in which a person with the specified tag is not free.
    * Pros: 
      * It is a robust solution, which if carried out correctly, would result in there being minimal effort in printing out the blocks of free time available.
    * Cons:
      * There are a number of edge cases to handle of high complexity due to overlapping timings between different contacts.
      
**Aspect: What partition size should we use?**
* **Alternative 1 (current implementation)**: Show common free timings in 30-minute blocks.
  * Pros:
    * More efficient implementation as 30-minute intervals would be ruled out as compared to 1-minute intervals
    * More easily understood by users who are likely to plan meetings in 30-minute intervals
  * Cons:
    * More meticulous planners will lament a lack of an ability to include intervals of less than 30 minutes.
* **Alternative 2**: Show common free timings accurate to the minute
  * Pros:
    * Feature would work for even the most meticulous of planners and could perhaps increase the benefit of the feature marginally
  * Cons:
    * Efficiency of implementation would be compromised to cater to a smaller target group.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4.6 ImportSchedule and ExportSchedule Features
This subsection details how the `importSchedule` and `exportSchedule` commands are implemented. This command allows the user to import and export the schedule of persons in UniGenda.

### Implementation
`ImportScheduleCommandParser` and `ImportScheduleCommand` classes are involved in the execution of the `importSchedule` command. While `ExportScheduleCommandParser` and `ExportScheduleCommand` classes are involved in the execution of the `exportSchedule` command. The `JsonUtil` and `JsonAdaptedSchedule` classes were also used to read and save the files during import and export.

The `parse` method of `ImportScheduleCommandParser` and `ExportScheduleCommandParser` receive the user input and extracts the required arguments.

A success execution of the `importSchedule` command is described as follows:

1. `ImportScheduleCommand` retrieves the `Person` from the `Model`, then reads using the `JsonUtil#readJsonFile` method.
2. `JsonAdaptedSchedule` is used to convert the information in the file into a `Schedule`.
3. The imported `Schedule` replaces the existing `Schedule` the `Person` had.
4. A `CommandResult` object indicating that the `importSchedule` command is successful will be created.
   
![ImportScheduleSequenceDiagram](images/ImportScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)

A success execution of the `exportSchedule` command is described as follows:

1. `ExportScheduleCommand` retrieves the `Person` form the `Model`.
2. `Schedule` of the `Person` is retrieved from the `Person`.
3. The `Schedule` is then saved on local memory using the `JsonUtil#saveJsonFile` method.
4. A `CommandResult` object indicating that the `exportSchedule` command is successful will be created.

![ExportScheduleSequenceDiagram](images/ExportScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)

### Design Considerations
**Aspect: What should we do existing schedules when importing?**
* **Alternative 1 (current implementation)**: We replace the existing schedule with the one that we imported.
  * Pros:
    * Easy implementation.
  * Cons:
    * User will lose existing schedule.
* **Alternative 2**: We merge existing schedule with the schedule we imported.
  * Pros:
    * User get to keep all old and new schedules.
  * Cons:
    * Harder to implement, requires a lot of checks like whether the imported schedule contains events that were already in the existing schedule.
    * Implementation might incur some wait time if there are many events that are being checked and added.

**Aspect: Where should we save the exported files?**
* **Alternative 1**: Users specify where they want files to be saved.
  * Pros:
    * Users will be able to save wherever they like.
  * Cons:
    * Harder to implement as we would have to check if the file path given is an absolute path or a relative path.
* **Alternative 2 (current implementation)**: We save the files in the data folder.
  * Pros:
    * Location for exported files will not change.
    * Location for exported files will not change.
    * Do not have to check if the file path is an absolute path or a relative path.

# 6. **Appendix A: Requirements**

## 6.1 Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* University students who have trouble keeping track of their own schedules
* Has university friends and/or project group mates with similarly packed schedules
* Find it difficult to synchronise their schedules with their friends to meet
* Need to plan project meetings often, but face difficulty scheduling a common time to meet
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast and prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: 

Problem:
With COVID causing home based learning to become the norm, meeting up with friends or project group mates in person has become a rarity for university students. It has also increased the need to schedule online meetings. But with everyone's tightly packed schedules, it is difficult to find that common time to meet or find friends who are free at particular dates and times!

How UniGenda solves the problem:
UniGenda improves the ease of finding common meeting times with contacts by allowing users to keep track of not only their own, but also their friends or project group mates' schedules!
