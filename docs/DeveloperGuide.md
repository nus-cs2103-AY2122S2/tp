### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about UI Class Diagram:**<br>

To make things more concise and for neatness, we have taken out the `UIPart` abstract class.
All classes associated with `MainWindow` and itself are connected to this abstract class (Again, not shown in the image below).

</div>

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CandidateListPanel`, `InterviewListPanel`, `FocusCard`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Candidate` or `Interview` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram_New.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a candidate).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram_New.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the TAlent Assistant™'s data i.e., all `Candidate` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCandidateList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Candidate` objects (e.g., results of a `find` or `sort` query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Candidate>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bounded to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores Candidates' `Interview` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueInterviewList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Interview` objects as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Interview>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bounded to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, interview schedule data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `InterviewScheduleStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note about `AddressBook` named classes:**<br>

TAlent Assistant™'s development team has decided to stick with AB3's naming convention for certain classes, unless otherwise stated.

</div>

### Add feature

#### What is the feature about?
The `add` mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. The implementation of adding a `Candidate` through the `add` command has been enhanced on the existing approach. It extends `Command`. The input parameters of the `add` command has been tweaked, introducing a few more related attributes.

The enhancement works by adding additional prefixes i.e. `id/[StudentId]`, `c/[Course]`, `yr/[Seniority]`, `avail/[Availability]`. As for the attributes `ApplicationStatus` and `InterviewStatus`, users are not required to enter a value for it as the default value of `PENDING` will be assigned.

#### How is the feature implemented?

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `add` mechanism behaves at each step.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** TAlent Assistant™ comes with preloaded data, user can execute the `clear` command for a fresh state.

</div>

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The program will be initialised with the preloaded data.

Step 2. The user proceeds to add a candidate by running the `add` command with its necessary arguments. The image provides an example of this step.

![AddStep2](images/AddStep2.png)

#### Why is the feature implemented as such?

The `add` command is done up with the goals of being as convenient and efficient as possible for the users. It is kept simple with easy to interpret and understandable prefixes that convey to the user on what is expected from their input.

#### UML Diagrams
**Activity Diagram**

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an `add` command:

<img src="images/AddActivityDiagram.png" />

### ApplicationStatus Feature

#### What is the feature about?

This feature implements a tagging system attached to the Candidate's profile in our Application. This way, our user can
easily see which candidates are `Accepted`, `Rejected`, or `Pending`. This will help enhance user experience when using our application.

#### How is the feature implemented?

This feature is currently embedded into the `EditCommand` feature. Currently, a user could edit the `ApplicationStatus` by using the
using the `Edit` command.

#### Why is the feature implemented as such?
We designed this tagging system is such a way that when a user is first added into the system, the user's `ApplicationStatus`
will be set to default of `pending`. This will help the user to minimise the amount of commands to type when adding in a Candidate.

The `ApplicationStatus` is currently implemented as a class by itself, and each `Candidate` has an `ApplicationStatus` embedded into their profile.
To change their status, the `EditCommandParser` will look out for the prefix to change the status, and will change their status accordingly.

In the initial phase of the project, we wanted the ApplicationStatus to be a `String` inside the `Candidate`. However after much consideration,
we have decided to make it a class of its own. This way, we can defensively design and code the `ApplicationStatus` and prevent any rouge data
from being entered.

#### UML Diagrams
**Activity Diagram**<br>
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `Edit ApplicationStatus` command: <br>
<img src="images/ApplicationStatusCommandDiagram.png" />


### InterviewStatus Feature

#### What is the feature about?

This feature implements a tagging system attached to the Candidate's profile in our Application. This way, our user can
easily see which candidates are `Scheduled`, `Not Scheduled`, or `Completed`. This will help enhance user experience when using our application.

#### How is the feature implemented?

This feature currently uses our `trigger` inside the Candidate class, namely `Candidate#triggerInterviewStatusNotScheduled()`,
`Candidate#triggerInterviewStatusScheduled()` and `Candidate#triggerInterviewStatusCompleted()`.

When a `Candidate` is scheduled for an interview, it will `trigger` the `InterviewStatus` of the Candidate to be `scheduled`.
When a `Candidate`'s interview is over, the trigger will automatically mark the `Candidate`'s `InterviewStatus` as `completed`.
If an interview date is deleted prematurely, the `InterviewStatus` of the `Candidate` will be reverted back to `Not Scheduled`.

#### Why is the feature implemented as such?
We designed this tagging system is such a way that when a user is first added into the system, the user's `ApplicationStatus`
will be set to default of `Not Scheduled`. This will help the user to minimise the amount of commands to type when adding in a Candidate.

In the initial planning phase of the project, we intended for the `InterviewStatus` to be `triggered` by many factors, such as `ApplicationStatus`,
the current date and time, etc.
However by coupling these two statuses together, the user will have lesser flexibility to change either `ApplicationStatus` or `InterviewStatus.
Hence we decided to keep them independent.

We also decided that when an interview is deleted prematurely, that the `InterviewStatus` will revert back to `not scheduled`, as it will help to differentiate
which `Candidate` has yet to be scheduled.

We also implemented a blocking system, such that if a `Candidate` has completed their interview, the system will not be able to schedule them for
another interview (by checking their `InterviewStatus`)

#### UML Diagrams
**Activity Diagram**<br>
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens for the `InterviewStatus` <br>
<img src="images/InterviewStatusDiagram.png" />



### Find feature

#### What is the feature about?
The `find` mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. The `find` command in `TAlent Assistant™`
has been enhanced based on the initial implementation of the `find` command in `AddressBook`.

The enhancement works by adding a new prefix in the `CliSyntax` class `k/`, which allows the
user to separate multiple keywords and `f/` which allows the user to specify which field the
`find` command should search for keywords under.

#### How is the feature implemented?
The main logic for `find` command is still implemented within `FindCommand` (which extends from `Command`) and
`FindCommandParser`.

The `FindCommandParser` class has been extended to include a switch-case block to validate
which field the user is trying to search across:
1. `studentId`
2. `course`
3. `seniority`
4. `name`
5. `email`
6. `phone`
7. `appStatus` (stands for candidate's application status)
8. `intStatus` (stands for candidate's interview status)
9. `avail` (stands for candidate's availability)
10. `all` (i.e. search across all fields of the candidate)

Based on the field validated by the switch-case block, a `new findCommand(new ContainsKeywordsPredicate(keywords))`
will be created. The implementation of the original `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` has been enhanced here.
There is now a `ContainsKeywordsPredicate` parent abstract class extended by each of the above listed fields as subclasses
(e.g. `StudentIdContainsKeywordsPredicate extends ContainsKeywordsPredicate`).

#### Why is the feature implemented as such?
**1. Switch-case block in `FindCommandParser`** <br>
Other alternatives considered included creating a separate class to execute the logic of checking for which field the
user had entered and return the new `ContainsKeywordsPredicate` subclass *or* to utilise `if`-`else` statements.
In the end, the implementation was done using the switch-case block within the `FindCommandParser` class, as the
class should contain all the necessary logic to parse in the user's input. The syntax for the switch-case block was
also more efficient than `if`-`else` statements and was more relevant for this usage.

**2. Inheritance of `ContainsKeywordsPredicate` to child classes**
Other alternatives considered included creating one single `ContainsKeywordsPredicate` class to implement all the
equality and keyword match checks for each and every field.
However, this would not meet good design principles - this would make it difficult to isolate and resolve bugs during
testing and make scalability and maintainability more complicated.
Further, since all the child classes implement similar logic and methods, it would make sense to create an
(abstract) parent class. This establishes the SRP principle, such that each subclass is only responsible for
checks for the specific related entity, and should not have any other reason to change otherwise.

**3. Allowing searches across multiple fields**
Currently the `find` command is implemented such that the parser will only validate the last `ATTRIBUTE_FIELD` parsed in
by the user, and execute the `ContainsKeywordsPredicate` test against it. An alternative was to allow searches across multiple
`ATTRIBUTE_FIELDS`. Though this is implementable by checking the validity of each of the `ATTRIBUTE_FIELD` parsed in,
it is considered out of scope in this particular iteration. Given as all the fields hold extremely different values,
the user is unlikely to be searching for the same set of keywords across multiple fields. Instead, following the behaviour
of other commands, the `FindCommandParser` will take in the last `f/` prefix.

#### UML Diagrams
**Activity Diagram**<br>
The following activity diagram summarizes a high level view of what happens when a user executes a `find` command: <br>
<img src="images/FindActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />


### Sort feature

#### What is the feature about?
The `sort` mechanism utilises the existing command class model from `AddressBook`. It introduces new methods and modifies current
implementation of existing methods in order to allow the user to sort the displayed candidates list by a specific
field.

A new `s/` prefix is added in the `CliSyntax`, which is used to accurately parse in the `ATTRIBUTE_FIELD` that the user
would like to sort the displayed candidate list by. The implementation in `SortCommand` class works by calling 
`model.updateSortedCandidateList(sortComparator)`, which updates the sorted order of the existing `CandidateList` in the system.

#### How is the feature implemented?
The parser for the `sort` command works similarly to all other commands implemented. In this case, as the user
may potentially key in multiple valid `s/` prefix fields, we utilise the `ArgumentTokenizer` in order to parse
in all the inputs, and only utilise the last `s/` prefix field.

The main logic for executing the `sort` command works within the `ModelManager` and `AddressBook` classes. When the
sort command is executed, a valid Comparator is passed as an argument into the `updateSortedCandidateList()` method, which
is called from the `ModelManager` class. Here, the `ModelManager` class acts as an intermediate layer
which then calls the `sortCandidates()` method in the `AddressBook` class.

The `sortCandidates()` method creates an exact copy of the existing `CandidateList` currently
in the system, before sorting it by the `Comparator` passed as its argument and setting
the new `CandidateList` in the system to be that of the sorted copy.

#### Why is the feature implemented as such?
**1. Modification of `ObservableList<Candidate>`**<br>
The `ObservableList<Candidate>` accessible by calling `getFilteredCandidateList()` in the `ModelManager` class
is an unmodifiable copy. In order to retain the integrity of data accessible through in the `ModelManager`, the modification of the candidate 
list is instead implemented within the `AddressBook` class. This separates the responsibilities of `AddressBook` class (which
wraps all data in the system) from the `ModelManager` class, which provides a slightly higher level of abstraction to access
the in memory data.

#### UML Diagrams
The following simplified partial sequence diagram showcases what happened when `execute` is called from the `LogicManager`.

Explanation of sequence when a `sort s/name` is parsed in is explained.

**Step 1.** (Not shown by diagram) The new `SortCommand` object is created with the `Comparator<Candidate>` object passed in as the argument when
the user enters the command.

**Step 2.** The`SortCommand#execute` method is called from `LogicManager` with the `Model` object passed in.

**Step 3.** `ModelManager#updateSortedCandidateList` is called, where the `ModelManager` class
implements the `Model` interface. The `Comparator<Candidate>` object is passed in as the argument.

**Step 4.** The `AddressBook#sortCandidates` is then called where a new copy of the candidate list is created as a `List<Candidate>` and sorted using the comparator.

**Step 5.** The candidate list in the system is then set as the new sorted copy using the `AddressBook#setCandidates` method call.

**Step 6.** Finally, `SortCommand#execute` method returns a new `CommandResult` object with feedback message to be displayed.

<img src="images/SortSequenceDiagram.png"/>


### Focus Feature

#### What is this feature about?
The 'focus' feature utilises the different panels in our application. It will bring up the intended Candidate's information,
such as course, email into the middle panel for the user to see.

#### How is this feature implemented?
This feature is implemented with the similar implementation of `CandidateListCard`, as we utilise the JavaFX codes to
create the `view`. We also introduced new features such as `ImageView`, where the extra information will consist of a display
picture for the Candidate.

#### Why is the feature implemented as such?
We created a new return value in `CommandResult` to get the `Index` of the intended Candidate. We implemented it this way
to not alter the existing database, as the intended purpose of this feature was not to edit the candidate's information.
We considered creating another database for this feature, by fetching more details from the secondary database, but we considered
that this will be a heavy headway for our application.

#### UML Diagram
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `focus` command.<br>

<img src="images/FocusCommandDiagram.png" />

### Scheduling interviews feature

#### What is this feature about?
The `AddScheduleCommand`, `EditScheduleCommand`, `DeleteScheduleCommand` and `ClearScheduleCommand` features allow
the user to add, edit, delete or clear all interviews respectively.

#### How is this feature implemented?
This feature is modelled after AB3's `add`, `edit`, `delete` and `clear` commands for consistency. Interview objects
created upon the `schedule add` command are contained in a `UniqueInterviewList` object and exposed to outsiders as
an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Interview>`.

#### Why is this feature implemented as such?
* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Newly created interviews are added to a list of interviews, and
  each interview object contains its corresponding `Candidate`.
    * Pros: No need to iterate through every candidate to initialise the interview schedule. Better performanece when
      editing or deleting interviews by index in the interview schedule.
    * Cons: Editing a `Candidate` attribute requires an update to their corresponding `Interview`'s `Candidate` object.
* Alternative 2: Every candidate has an `Interview` attribute, initialised to null. When a candidate is scheduled for an
  interview, the newly created interview is assigned to be the candidate's `Interview` attribute.
    * Pros: Editing a `Candidate` attribute does not affect their `Interview` attribute.
    * Cons: Interview schedule has to iterate through every candidate to search for existing interviews during initialisation.
  Editing or deleting interviews by index from the interview schedule would require further iterations through the candidate list
  to find the target interview.

#### UML Diagram
Below is a simplified sequence diagram showing how an `AddScheduleCommand` is parsed under the `Logic` 
component when a user adds an interview to the schedule. Note that all four schedule commands `AddScheduleCommand`, 
`EditScheduleCommand`, `DeleteScheduleCommand` and `ClearScheduleCommand` follow a similar structure.

<img src="images/ScheduleLogicDiagram.png"/>

Below is another sequence diagram with a more in depth view of how the `AddScheduleCommand` is executed after parsing.

<img src="images/AddScheduleSequenceDiagram.png"/>

Explanation of sequence when a `AddScheduleCommand` is called.

**Step 1.** The user executes the command `schedule add candidate/1 at/24-05-2022`.

**Step 2.** User input is passed to the `AddressBookParser`, which calls `ScheduleCommandParser#parse`, 
which then calls `AddScheduleCommandParser#parse` to create a new `AddScheduleCommand`.

**Step 3.** The `AddScheduleCommand` will then be executed by calling its `execute` method.

**Step 4.** Since the Model is passed to `AddScheduleCommand#execute`, it is able to call a method `Model#getFilteredCandidateList` to get the last candidate list shown.

**Step 5.** From the candidate list, we can find the desired candidate to schedule for interview by calling the `get` function with the specified Index.

**Step 6.** A new `Interview` is created for the candidate and the Model#addInterview method is called to add the `Interview` to the Model.

**Step 7.** After the interview is successfully added, we call the `Candidate#triggerInterviewStatusScheduled` method which returns
the `Candidate` with his interview status set to `Scheduled`. The Model will then call Model#setCandidate to update the candidate in the list.
