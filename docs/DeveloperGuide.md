### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI. `HelpWindow` and `PackageWindow` opens a new pop up window, displaying the link to the User Guide and the details of the `InsurancePackage` object respectively. 

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.
* The `PackageCard` component depends on some classes in the `Model` component as it displays an `InsurancePackage` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding Clip feature

The addition of the clip feature is facilitated by the `AddToClipboardCommand`, `AddToClipboardCommandParser`, and `NameExistsPredicate` classes.

`AddToClipboardCommandParser` parses the input to obtain the name/index of the client that the user wishes to clip. It then creates a `NameExistsPredicate`, which it passes to a `AddToClipboardCommand`. When `Commmand#execute` is called, `AddToClipboardCommand` uses the `NameExistsPredicate` to filter out exact matches to the given name via the `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` method.

![Clip Command Sequence Diagram](images/ClipCommandSeqMain.PNG)

If a name is specified:
![Clip Command Sequence Diagram](images/ClipCommandSeqSD.PNG)

If an index is specified:
![Clip Command Sequence Diagram](images/ClipCommandSeqSD2.PNG)

### Adding Priority Level feature

The addition of priorities is facilitated by the `Tag` and `Priority` classes. In addition to a `tagName`, the tag now also has a priority level, represented by the `Priority` enum.

![PersonsAndPriorities](images/PersonsAndPriorities.png)

Currently, there are 4 priority levels that a tag can have, as provided by the `Priority` enum. If unspecified, the default `Priority` is `null`. The priority of a tag is set by the `ParserUtil`'s methods- specifically using `parseTag` and `parsePriority`

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: TBD:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Give Priority to Tag
  * Pros: Can go into detail. Tasks the agent has to do can be captured in the tags. For the same person, some tasks may be very urgent and some may not be as urgent. The specifics can be conveyed much better.
  * Cons: Not very easy to implement. Hard to adapt for future features (e.g. how to sort by priority in the future)

* **Alternative 2:** Give Priority to Person
  itself.
  * Pros: Easier to implement, and easy to extend for future features such as `sort`.
  * Cons: We cannot give so much nuance- if someone has some issues that are urgent, and others that aren't, this cannot be captured.
  
#### Listing by priority
The PriorityList() command. facilitated by `PriorityListCommand` and `TagPriorityComparator`, allows users to sort and display their client list by the priority level of their contact's tags. 
A client with multiple tags will have the priority level of the highest priority out of all of his/her tags.

**Aspect: How prioList executes:**
![PrioListSeq](images/PrioListCommandSeq.PNG)

### Adding more fields for Find
Having multiple fields for the `FindCommand` is facilitated by the improvement of the `FindCommandParser` and the creation of different types of `Predicate`. The `CombineContainsKeywordsPredicate` is used in order to combine the various `Predicate` for multiple fields searching. It is the main driver for `FindCommand#execute(model)` in updating the filteredPersonsList.

The improved `FindCommandParser` makes use of the `ArgumentMultimap` and the `ArgumentTokenizer` (similar to how it is implemented in the `AddCommandParser`) to retrieve the prefix-argument mapping. The `Parse` command in `FindCommandParser` uses the `ArgumentMultimap` generated by the `ArgumentTokenizer`'s tokenize method to create the relevant `Predicate` related to the field that the user has stated.

The different `Predicate` inherits from the `FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate`. The`CombineContainsKeywordsPredicate` is the combination of the various `Predicate`.
- Each subclass of `FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate` implements a concrete method `test` relevant to filtering the Person for the particular field.
- `CombineContainsKeywordsPredicate` makes use of all the subclasses of `FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate` `test` method in order to update the filteredPersonList from the `Model` using all the `FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate` created.

![FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate](images/FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate.png)

#### Design considerations:
The `FindCommandParser` was implemented this way as there are multiple prefixes in the new multi-field find command. So it requires a mapping of the different prefixes with their respective arguments.

The predicate is implemented in this way since updating the filteredPersonList in the `Model` class requires a single `Predicate`, so a single `CombineContainsKeywordsPredicate` was used, where the `CombineContainsKeywordsPredicate#test(person)` will make use of all the subclasses of `FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate` to update the filteredPersonList.

**Aspect: How FindCommand executes:**

![FindCommandSequence](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

![ParseFindSequence](images/ParseFindSequenceDiagram.png)

![FindCommand](images/FindCommand.png)

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A combined predicate that makes use of the different subclasses of `FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate`
    * Pros: More modularised as it makes use of the individual predicates for each field.
    * Cons: May have some redundancy

* **Alternative 2:** Using just one predicate to encompass all the fields
    * Pros: Code is cleaner and less redundant
    * Cons: Implementation and testing might be harder as it is less modularised
    

### Adding the ability to export AddressBook to CSV and back

The ability to convert a collection of Persons to a CSV file is facilitated by `CsvUtil` and `CsvAdaptedPerson`.

`CsvAdaptedPerson` is a CSV-friendly version of `Person`, with a method that allows it to be converted to a CSV-friendly string, while `CsvUtil` allows for the writing of a `CsvAdaptedPerson` object to a CSV file.

The implementation of writing the AddressBook to CSV is as follows:

When the user wishes to save the current state of the AddressBook to CSV, either through the `export` command or by clicking on the button in the dropdown, the following events occur:

Step 1: `MainWindow#handleSaveToCsv` is called, which:
- calls `MainWindow#handleSaveFile` to obtain a destination file location from the user to save to.
- then calls `LogicManager#saveAddressBookToCsv`

Step 2: `LogicManager#saveAddressBookToCsv`is called, which calls `StorageManager#saveAddressBookToCsv`

Step 3: `StorageManager#saveAddressBookToCsv` is called, which calls `CsvAddressBookStorage#saveAddressBook`

Step 4: `CsvAddressBookStorage#saveAddressBook` is called, which
- creates a file at the given location, if it does not exist yet
- generates a `List` of `CsvAdaptedPerson` from the AddressBook
- calls `CsvUtil#saveCsvFile`

Step 5: `CsvUtil#saveCsvFile` is called, which writes the contents of the AddressBook to the CSV file.

![Save AddressBook to CSV](images/SaveAddressBookToCsv.png)

A similar flow of events occur for the loading of a CSV file to the AddressBook.

#### Design considerations:

The functionality was implemented this way to stick to the existing codebase as much as possible.

There is existing functionality to export the AddressBook to JSON, hence the classes involved with CSV files are organised and structured in a similar way.

### Adding the ability to Undo/Redo certain commands

List of undo-able/redo-able commands: an `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`, `addTag`, `deleteTag` and `editTag`.

The ability to undo/redo is facilitated by `ModelManager` and `UndoRedoStorage`. The 
`ModelManager` creates a copy of the current address book as an `AddressBook` and stores it in `UndoRedoStorage`. 

`ModelManager` implements the following operations:

- ModelManager#copyAddressBook() - Makes a copy of the current address book.
- ModelManager#undoCommand() - Reverts the address book to a copy before the last undo-able command.
- ModelManager#redoCommand() - Reverts the address book to a copy before the last undone command.

It is supported by `UndoRedoStorage` which implements the following operations:

- UndoRedoStorage#addToUndo() - Adds the given `AddressBook` to the list of `AddressBook` states to be used by `UndoRedoStorage#undo()`.
- UndoRedoStorage#undo() - Returns the previous `AddressBook` state.
- UndoRedoStorage#redo() - Returns the previously undone `AddressBook` state.
- UndoRedoStorage#resetRedoStack() - Resets the stack of previously undone `AddressBook` states.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state. `ModelManager#copyAddressBook()` is called to make a copy of the `AddressBook`, and 
that copy is stored in the `UndoRedoStorage` via `UndoRedoStorage#addToUndo()`.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `ModelManager#copyAddressBook()` after the person is deleted, making a copy of the new `AddressBook` without the deleted person and 
that copy is stored in the `UndoRedoStorage` via `UndoRedoStorage#addToUndo()`. There are currently two `AddressBook` states inside `UndoRedoStorage`.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `ModelManager#copyAddressBook()` after adding the new person and stores a copy of the new `AddressBook` in `UndoRedoStorage`. 
There are currently three `AddressBook` states inside `UndoRedoStorage`.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `ModelManager#copyAddressBook()` and `UndoRedoStorage#addToUndo()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `UndoRedoStorage`.

</div>

Step 3. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCommand()`, which will call `UndoRedoStorage#undo()`. 
It adds the current `AddressBook` state to a stack which stores the undone states of the `AddressBook`. It then shifts the pointer to the previous `AddressBook` state and returns that `AddressBook` state to the `Model`.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial `AddressBook` state, then there are no previous `AddressBook` states to restore. 
The `undo` command checks the size of the List storing the `AddressBook` states to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoCommand()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the `AddressBook` to that state.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `ModelManager#copyAddressBook()` and `UndoRedoStorage#addToUndo()`. Thus, the list storing the `AddressBook` states in `UndoRedoStorage` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `ModelManager#copyAddressBook()` and `UndoRedoStorage#addToUndo()`. The `UndoRedoStorage#resetRedoStack()` command is called after the `AddressBook` has been cleared to remove all previously stored undone `AddressBook` states.
The current `AddressBook` state is then added to `UndoRedoStorage` via `UndoRedoStorage#addToUndo()`. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦a` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

#### Areas for improvement:

**Aspect: Implementing Undo & redo for Packages:**

* **Possible implementation:** `UndoRedoStorage` stores both `AddressBook` state and `InsurancePackagesSet` state.
    * Pros: Easy to implement. Change existing `UndoRedoStorage` methods to accommodate both data by using a wrapper class to encapsulate both `AddressBook` state and `InsurancePackagesSet` state.
    * Issues: `Undo` and `Redo` were able to work as intended for commands that alter `AddressBook` states such as `add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`.
             however, it is able to `Undo` and `Redo` commands for commands that alter `InsurancePackagesSet` states such as `addp`, `deletep` and `editp`
                but at a certain point, the previous `InsurancePackagesSet` states stored in `UndoRedoStorage` becomes mutated which gives rise to erroneous behaviours when executing 'Undo' and 'Redo'.
    * Fix: `InsurancePackagesSet()` might have to be changed as it is suspected that the method was mutating the date in the `UndoRedoStorage`.

testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   2. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   2. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   3. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.
