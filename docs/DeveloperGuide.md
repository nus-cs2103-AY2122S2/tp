### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 1. Friends Feature

- Add friend
- Delete friend
- 

#### 1.1 Add friend

##### Implementation

The implementation of adding a friend into Amigos is facilitated by the 'AddCommand', 'AddCommandParser' in the `Logic` component,
`UniquePersonList` and `Person` classes in the `Model` component, and `JsonAdaptedPerson` in the `Storage` component.

A friend is a `Person` containing attributes - `FriendName`, `Phone`, `Address`, `Email`, `Description`, `Set<Tag>`
containing a set of `Tag` objects and a `UniqueLogList` containing a list of `Log` objects.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Logic` and `Model` components behave at every
step.

1. User keys in a valid `AddCommand` `e.g. addfriend n/John Doe t/Friend` into the command box of the GUI.
2. `AddressBookParser` calls `AddCommandParser::parse` and parses the input.
   - `AddCommandParser::parse` converts the arguments entered by user into `Person` attributes by calling 
       the`ParserUtil`class. It then instantiates a new `Person` with the given attributes returned by `ParserUtil`. 
       (`ParserUtil` checks for the validity of the inputs according to the respective attribute constraints.
       Next, an `AddCommand` is created with the new `Person` passed into it.
3. When `AddCommand::execute` is called, the `Model` component will check if the `Person` to be added already
   exists in Amigos. This check is done using `Model::hasPerson` which ultimately uses `Person::isSamePerson`
   to check if two `Person` are equal by name only. 
4. If no duplicate person exists, then `Model::addPerson` will be called and the newly created `Person` will 
   be set into the `model` and added into the `UniquePersonList`.

A sequence diagram showing the interactions between `AddCommand`, `AddCommandParser`, `ParserUtil` and `model`, 
after the user has entered a valid `FriendName`, `Phone`, and `Email`.
![AddFriendSequenceDiagram](images/AddFriendSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Considerations

**Aspect**: How to store optional fields in a Person
Minimally, the `AddCommand` requires the user to enter the `FriendName` of the new `Person` to be added using the `n/` prefix. 
The other fields are optional. This is to allow flexibility for the user to add a friend into Amigos even if the user is unsure 
about certain particulars (e.g `Address`/ `Email`) of a friend.

* Current implementation
  - To allow this, we place a `null` value into the value of the optional attribute that was not provided by the user.
   For example, if an address is not given, then for the newly created `Person` object `p`, `p.address.value` will be `null`.
  - Whenever a `Person` object is instantiated, we ensure that all the attributes are non-null.
  
* Alternative implementation
  - An alternative way is to simply pass `null` directly into the `Person` attributes. For example, if an address is not given,
    then simply make `p.address` to be `null`. 
  - While this may seem more convenient, it is error-prone because we would be passing null values around which
    makes the occurrence of exceptions such as `NullPointerException` highly likely.
 
**Aspect**: How to check that a `Person` already exists in Amigos
Similar to AB3, Amigos prevents a user from adding a duplicate `Person`. 

* Current implementation
  - We check whether a `Person` is already in Amigos by `Person::isSamePerson` which makes use of `FriendName::equals`.
    Furthermore, we made `FriendName::equals` case-insensitive, thus disallowing users from adding a person with the same 
    name but in different capitalisation. 

* Alternative implementations 
  - An alternative way is to define equality of 2 `Person` objects in a stricter way - to make sure that all the attributes
    are the same (not just the `FriendName`) for 2 `Person` objects to be considered as duplicates. This means that more
    checks must be done. 
  - Another alternative way to define equality of 2 `Person` objects would be by using case-sensitive `FriendName`, but
    we decided that our current implementation makes more logical sense.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 200 friends with up to 100 events/logs per person without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage (time taken to process any one command is 1 second at most).
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish all the basic tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The project only supports managing of the user friendships and not other types of relationships.
5. The application should work with different screen sizes, resolutions and window sizes (minimum resolution is 600x450).

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Log**: Details of interaction between user and friend
* **Event**: Upcoming meeting/ date of significance for a friend
