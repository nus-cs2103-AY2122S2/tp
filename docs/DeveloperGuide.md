### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `rms 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="450" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="225" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

[return to top ↑](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component
The **API** of this component is specified in `Ui.java`

![](images/UiPhotos/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of multiple parts eg. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, 
`StudentListPanel`, `InfoPanel` etc. All these components, including the `MainWindow` inherits from the abstract
`UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files 
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the 
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in 
[`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,
- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` component to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<img src="images/UiPhotos/BottomHalf.png" width="600" />

The bottom half of the `UI` component is split into two parts using a `SplitPane` component from 
the JavaFX UI framework. 

The left pane contains a `TabPane` that contains two tabs which hold a 
[`LessonListPanel`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/listpanel/LessonListPanel.java) and a
[`StudentListPanel`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/listpanel/StudentListPanel.java).
The **_Lessons_** tab contains a 
[`LessonListPanel`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/listpanel/LessonListPanel.java) which lists out `Lesson` entries 
while the **_Students_** tab contains a 
[`StudentListPanel`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/listpanel/StudentListPanel.java) which lists out `Student`
entries.

To switch between the tabs, the methods `MainWindow#toggleLessonTab()` and `MainWindow#toggleStudentTab()` can be used 
to switch between the **_Lesson_** tab and **_Student_** tab respectively. Switching the tabs by using user commands is 
done by the method `MainWindow#toggleTab()`.

![img.png](images/UiPhotos/InfoPanelClassDiagram.png)

The right pane contains an [`InfoPanel`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/infopanel/InfoPanel.java) 
component can either show the details of a `Lesson` entry or `Student` entry. A
[`LessonInfoPanel`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/infopanel/LessonInfoPanel.java) is used to show the details of a 
`Lesson` entry, while a [`StudentInfoPanel`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/infopanel/StudentInfoPanel.java) is used
to show the details of a `Student` entry.

The methods `MainWindow#populateInfoPanelWithLesson()` and `MainWindow#populateInfoPanelWithStudent()` can be used to
populate the `InfoPanel` with the provided entry. Populating the `InfoPanel` using user commands is handled by the 
method `MainWindow#handleInfoPanelUpdate()`.

Refer to [Viewing a Lesson or Student's details](#viewing-a-lesson-or-students-details) implementation.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TeachWhatParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteStudentCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("rms 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `rms 1` Command](images/DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:
<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TeachWhatParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `DeleteStudentCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `DeleteStudentCommand`) which the `TeachWhatParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

[return to top ↑](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![Model Class Diagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `ModelManager` component,
* stores the student book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the lesson book data i.e., all `Lesson` objects (which are contained in a `ConsistentLessonList` object).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.

the `ModelManager` component also,
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* similarly, it stores the currently 'selected' `Lesson` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Lesson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

Each `Lesson` has an association with a list of `EnrolledStudents`, which contains references to each `Student` assigned to the lesson.

![Model Class Diagram](images/LessonBookStudentBookModelClassDiagram.png)

[return to top ↑](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`StorageManager.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="600"/>

The `Storage` component
* saves lesson book data, student book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into the 
corresponding objects.
* inherits from `LessonBookStorage`, `StudentBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any 
one of the three (if only the functionality of one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component because its job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Viewing a Lesson or Student's details

Viewing details of a `Lesson` or `Student` on the `InfoPanel` component in the `UI` is done through the `lesson` or 
`student` command.

When the command is entered, the 
[`TeachWhatParser`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/TeachWhatParser.java)
would **parse** the given user input and return either a 
[`ViewLessonInfoCommand`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/ViewLessonInfoCommand.java)
or [`ViewStudentInfoCommand`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/ViewStudentInfoCommand.java) 
object, depending on which command was used. 

When the Command is executed by `Logic`, the executed command would make some attribute changes to `Model` (which holds
the data of the App in memory) and also update the `InfoPanel` component of the `UI` with detailed information of the 
selected `Lesson` or `Student`. A more detailed explanation is shown below.

Given below is an example where a user inputs `student 1` as a command to view the details of the first student on the 
list.

#### Step 1: User inputs `student 1` into the `CommandBox` and hits enter.

[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
receives the user input through the `MainWindow#executeCommand()` method. 
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
then sends the user input to `Logic` and retrieves the result.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Step 2: `Logic` parses the user's input and returns the result

![](images/viewing-details/ViewStudentParseSequenceDiagram.png)

`Logic` parses the user's input through multiple `Parser` classes as shown in the sequence diagram above. User
input is first sent to the [`TeachWhatParser`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/TeachWhatParser.java)
where it looks for the main command `student`. It passes the arguments to
the relevant **Command Parser** which in this case is 
[`ViewStudentInfoParser`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ViewStudentInfoCommandParser.java).

[`ViewStudentInfoParser`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ViewStudentInfoCommandParser.java)
takes in the provided index and creates a 
[`ViewStudentInfoCommand`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/ViewStudentInfoCommand.java).
This `Command` is returned back to `LogicManager` where it is executed with the `ViewStudentInfoCommand#execute()` method.

#### Step 3: Executing the command

As shown in the diagram above, when `ViewStudentInfoCommand#execute()` is called,
[`ViewStudentInfoCommand`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/ViewStudentInfoCommand.java)
retrieves the filtered list (the current list shown in the UI) from `Model` and picks out the selected student based on
the index provided by the user's input. It then sets `ModelManager#selectedStudent` using the 
`ModelManager#setSelectedStudent()` method, which will be used by
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
later on.

[`ViewStudentInfoCommand`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/ViewStudentInfoCommand.java)
creates a 
[`CommandResult`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/CommandResult.java)
object, with the parameter `infoPanelType = InfoPanelTypes.STUDENT`. 
[`InfoPanelTypes`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/misc/InfoPanelTypes.java)
is an enumerator representing the different states of the InfoPanel. This is then returned to `LogicManager` which
returns it back to `MainWindow`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Step 4: Updating the UI

<img src="images/viewing-details/ViewStudentSequenceDiagram.png" width="500"/>

Once 
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) 
receives the 
[`CommandResult`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/CommandResult.java)
object, it checks for the `CommandResult#updateInfoPanel` boolean. If the
boolean is true, it runs the `MainWindow#handleInfoPanelUpdate()` method which updates the `InfoPanel`. It does this by
retrieving the selected student from `ModelManager#selectedStudent` and creates a new
[`StudentInfoPanel`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/infopanel/StudentInfoPanel.java)
with the selected student and its details. The newly created
[`StudentInfoPanel`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/infopanel/StudentInfoPanel.java)
is shown on the right side of the application.

The execution of the command is complete and the result is shown in the image below, where the right side of the
application is updated with the details of the selected `Student`.

<img src="images/viewing-details/UiExample.png" width="500" />

A similar process is done when using the `lesson` command but with its corresponding `Parser` and `Command` objects.

[return to top ↑](#table-of-contents)

### Add student
Adding a new `Student` to TeachWhat! is done through the `LogicManager`. The user input is parsed by the 
`TeachWhatParser` into a `Command` which is executed by `LogicManager#execute()`.

Given below is an example scenario:

The user wants to add a student that has the following details,
- `name`: Samuel
- `phone`: 64874982
- `email`: simp4raiden@gmail.com
- `address`: 6 Raffles Quay Singapore, 048580 Singapore
- `tag`: struggling in math
- `tag`: good in cs

Step 1. The user enters the command

``addstudent -n Samuel -p 64874982 -e simp4raiden@gmail.com -a 6 Raffles Quay Singapore, 048580 Singapore -t struggling in math -t good in cs``

Step 2. The user input is passed into `LogicManager#execute(commandText)`.

Step 3. `LogicManager` uses the `TeachWhatParser#parseCommand(userInput)` to parse the user input.

Step 4. The `TeachWhatParser` detects the command word `addstudent` and passes the student details to `AddStudentCommandParser#parse(args)`.

Step 5. The `AddStudentCommandParser` uses `ArgumentMultimap` to map the student details into the prefixes `name`, `phone`, `email`, `address` and `tag`, and constructs a new `Student`
which is then used to construct and return `AddStudentCommand`.

* Constraints
    * Multiple `tag` prefixes can be given but only one `name`, `phone`, `email` and `address` can be given.
    * All the prefixes are optional except for `name` and `phone`

      `ParseException` will be thrown if the constraints are violated

![](images/AddStudentSequenceDiagram-0.png)

Step 6. The `LogicManager` then executes the `AddStudentCommand` and the `Student` is added to the `Student Book` if another `Student` with the same name does not already exist.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add student command works.  

![](images/AddStudentSequenceDiagram-1.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Choice 1**  
Required prefixes: `name` and `phone`
Optional prefixes: `email`, `address` and `tag`
Advantages: This improves user experience as the tutor may not want to keep track of them.
Disadvantages: It may cause some students to have email address and some to not have them. This may cause inconsistencies.

**Choice 2**  
Required prefixes: `name`, `phone` and `email`
Optional prefixes: `address` and `tag`
Advantages: This improves user experience as the tutor may not want to keep track of addresses.
Disadvantages: It requires the tutor to know the email address as well for all his students.

We decided on **Choice 1** because it felt tedious for the user to ask for the email address of every student.
This split of required and optional fields allows us to maintain the minimal amount of information required by a tutor 
and improve user experience by improving typing speed as the user does not have to enter every field.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Delete student or lesson
Deleting a `Student` or `Lesson` to TeachWhat! is done through the `LogicManager`. The user input is parsed by the
`TeachWhatParser` into a `Command` which is executed by `LogicManager#execute()`.

Given below is an example scenario:

The user wants to delete a student that is of index 1 on the viewable student list,

Step 1. The user enters the command `rml 1`

Step 2. The user input is passed into `LogicManager#execute(commandText)`.

Step 3. `LogicManager` uses the `TeachWhatParser#parseCommand(userInput)` to parse the user input.

Step 4. The `TeachWhatParser` detects the command word `rml` and passes the student details to `DeleteLessonCommandParser#parse(args)`.

Step 5. The `DeleteLessonCommandParser` uses `ParserUtil#parseIndex(oneBasedIndex)` to parse the one-based index of the lesson to be deleted into a zero-based `Index`. This is used to construct a new
`DeleteLessonCommand` which it then returns.

* Constraints
   * `ParserUtil#parseIndex(oneBasedIndex)` rejects non-positive integers (i <= 0)
   * `ParserUtil#parseIndex(oneBasedIndex)` rejects values that are not of type `java.lang.Integer`
     `ParseException` will be thrown if the constraints are violated

Step 6. The `LogicManager` then executes the `DeleteLessonCommand` and the `Lesson` is removed from the `Lesson Book`.

* Constraint
  * The `Index` in `DeleteStudentCommand` must not be greater than or equal to the size of the viewable student list.
    `ParseException` will be thrown if the constraints are violated

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add temporary/recurring lesson
Adding a new `Lesson` to TeachWhat! follows a process that is similar to adding a new `Student`, with the following key differences,
- the `TeachWhatParser` detects the command word `addlesson` and passes the lessons details to `AddLessonCommandParser#parse`
- the `AddLessonCommandParser` then maps the arguments into the prefixes `lessonName`, `subject`, `lessonAddress`, `date`, `time`, `recurring`, `hours` and `minutes`
- after which it constructs a new `Lesson` and passes it to the `AddLessonComand` 

The following sequence diagram shows how the add lesson operation works when a user enters the following command:
`addlesson
-n Sec 2 Biology Lesson
-s Biology -a Blk 11 Ang Mo Kio Street 74, #11-04
-d 17-04-2022 -t 18:00 -h 1`

![Add Lesson Sequence Diagram 1](images/AddLessonSequenceDiagram_1.png)

The following sequence diagram shows,
- how an `AddLessonCommand` is instantiated from the given user input
- how a new instance of a `TemporaryLesson` or `RecurringLesson` is instantiated from the arguments given by the user

![Add Lesson Sequence Diagram 2](images/AddLessonSequenceDiagram_2.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how `AddLessonCommand`
- sets the newly added lesson as the selected lesson in the UI through `Model`

![Add Lesson Sequence Diagram 3](images/AddLessonSequenceDiagram_3.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how `AddLessonCommand`
- updates the UI to show a list of conflicting lessons by updating the filtered lesson list through `Model` using an instance of `ConflictingLessonsPredicate`

![Add Lesson Sequence Diagram 4](images/AddLessonSequenceDiagram_4.png)


#### Determining if a lesson clashes with any existing lessons

When a user requests to add a new lesson to the list, it is important to check that the new lesson ***does not clash with any existing lessons in the list.***

This is done by the `ConsistentLessonList` class, which enforces ***consistency*** between existing lessons stored in the list.

A list of lessons is considered ***consistent*** when no lessons clash with each another. In particular, the following two conditions are enforced by the `ConsistentLessonList`:
- no two temporary lessons should have overlapping timeslots (ie: a lesson should ***not*** start when another lesson has not ended)
- no recurring lesson should have overlapping timeslots with any temporary lesson or recurring lesson that falls on the same weekday as it

This is done with the method `ConsistentLessonList#hasConflictingLesson()`, which takes in the `Lesson` to be added and
- goes through the list and compares each *existing* `Lesson` with it
- and returns true if any existing lessons clashes with it

The following sequence diagram shows how this is done:

![Add Lesson Sequence Diagram 5](images/AddLessonSequenceDiagram_5.png)

### Assign student to lesson

The feature assigns a `Student` to a `Lesson`. The `AssignCommand` class 
extends the `Command` and overwrites the `Command#execute()` method.

Using the `Model` object passed in as an argument of the `AssignCommand#execute()`
method, the following methods are invoked in the `AssignCommand#execute()` method:
* `Model#updateAssignment()`
    * adds `Student` to the `enrolledStudents` attribute `Lesson`
    * adds `Lesson` to the `enrolledLessons` attribute of the `Student`
* `Model#setSelectedStudent()` - sets the `selectedStudent` attribute of `Model` to
the `Student` that is being assigned. This is done to display the `Student` details
in the `MainWindow#InfoPanel`.


The `AssignCommand#execute()` method returns a `CommandResult` upon a
successful assignment.


Given below is an example usage scenario on how the assign command works.

#### Step 1: The user launches the application and executes the following
* `addlesson -n Sec 2 Math...` which adds a `Lesson` named "Sec 2 Math".
* `addstudent -n David...` which adds a `Student` named "David".

![](images/AssignState0-Initial_state.png)

#### Step 2: The user executes the following to find the respective IDs of the `Student` and `Lesson`.
* `listlessons` command to see that the `Lesson` named "Sec 2 Math" has a `LESSON_ID` of 1.
* `liststudents` command to see that the `Student` named "David" has a `STUDENT_ID` of 1.

#### Step 3: The user executes the command `assign -s 1 -l 1`. The command does the following:
* adds `Student` "David" to the `enrolledStudents` attribute of the `Lesson` "Sec 2 Math".
* adds `Lesson` "Sec 2 Math" to the `enrolledLessons` attribute of the `Student` "David".

The following sequence diagram shows how the assign operation works.

### Help feature

The feature shows a table of commands with a short description, the command words and their shortcuts. 
If the user wants to know more about the commands, there is a hyperlink to the user guide.

This feature is implemented in the `HelpWindow`.

All commands are stored as `CommandCard` that is used by a `TableView<CommandCard>` to display the information.
The `TableView<CommandCard` is made up of three `TableColumn<CommandCard>` corresponding to each field of a `CommandCard`.

A `CommandCard` contains the `description`, `commandWord` and `commandShortcut` fields.
These are used by `TableColumn<CommandCard>` to create the columns of each corresponding field.

Given below is a class diagram of `TableView<CommandCard>`.

<img align="center" src="images/TableView.png"/>

**Design considerations**  
The `CommandCard` class became a nested class because there were no other features that would be implemented that need to use it. Only the `HelpWindow` requires it,
thus, it was made as a nested class.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Command Shortcuts

Command shortcuts were implemented for commands that have a lengthy `COMMAND_WORD`. This was done by adding another field `SHORTENED_COMMAND_WORD`.

**Design Considerations**

The shortcuts were implemented in `TeachWhatParser` by using fallthroughs in a `switch-case` block. This was done because the code would be more readable and
it would be easier to implement.
There was some consideration over whether we should use ```if-else``` statements instead but this was rejected as it would cause the code to be difficult to read compared to
`case` statements.  

There was also some debate about using a command list in each `Command` to hold both the command word and shortcut if it exists.
This would make adding more commands trivial as `TeachWhatParser` would check the command list in each command.
However, this was rejected because it would take a lot of time to implement and the current iteration would only be using at most two command words (`COMMAND_WORD` and `SHORTENED_COMMAND_WORD`).
If we had a feature that allows the user to create custom command words for each command then only would it be worthwhile to implement but we did not plan on adding that feature.

### Saving data

#### Missing data files
When using TeachWhat! (or any program), there is always a possibility that data-files would go missing. This could either be due to errors caused by the operating-system, or by the user deleting the data-files.

To simulate this scenario, follow the steps below:

1. Create an **empty folder**, and place the `TeachWhat!.jar` inside it.
2. Start the program by following the quick-start instructions in the [User Guide](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w11-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start).
3. Exit the program by entering the `exit` command in the command-box.
   - At this point, you should see that some new files and folders have been created in the folder.
4. Open the folder named **"data"**, and delete both **"lessonbook.json"** and **"studentbook.json"**
    - At this point, the "data" folder would be empty.
5. Start the program again.
   - You should see that the program would start with the default sample list of lessons and students.

As seen in the steps above, the expected-behaviour for missing data-files is that TeachWhat! would simply create another new data-file pre-populated with sample data (as if the user is using the program for the first time.)

#### Corrupted data-files
When using TeachWhat! (or any program), there is always a possibility that data-files would become corrupted. This could either be due to errors caused by the operating-system, or by the user manually-editing the data-files.

To simulate this scenario, follow the steps below:

1. Create an **empty folder**, and place the `TeachWhat!.jar` inside it.
2. Start the program by following the quick-start instructions in the [User Guide](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w11-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start).
3. Exit the program by entering the `exit` command in the command-box.
    - At this point, you should see that some new files and folders have been created in the folder.
4. Open the folder named **"data"**, and open the data-file named **"lessonbook.json"** using a text-editor of your choice.
5. To simulate the file becoming corrupted, you may remove or add some items into the JSON file.
   - In this case, we can simply remove the opening square-bracket from the JSON file, rendering it unreadable, like so:

  "lessons" : [ {                                   // <---------- to remove [
    "lessonName" : "Make up lesson for George",
    "subject" : "Geography",
    "dateTimeSlot" : {
      "dateOfLesson" : "5-1-2022",
      "durationHours" : "2",
      "durationMinutes" : "0",
      "startTime" : "17:50"
    },
    "isRecurring" : false,
    "assignedStudents" : [ ],
    "lessonAddress" : "Blk 47 Tampines Street 20, #17-35"
  }
  // ......
}
```

##### After change
```
{
  "lessons" : {                                   // <---------- removed [
    "lessonName" : "Make up lesson for George",
    "subject" : "Geography",
    "dateTimeSlot" : {
      "dateOfLesson" : "5-1-2022",
      "durationHours" : "2",
      "durationMinutes" : "0",
      "startTime" : "17:50"
    },
    "isRecurring" : false,
    "assignedStudents" : [ ],
    "lessonAddress" : "Blk 47 Tampines Street 20, #17-35"
  }
  // ......
}
```

6. Start the program again.
    - You should see that the program would start with an **EMPTY** list of lessons and students.

As seen in the steps above, the expected-behaviour for corrupted data-files is that TeachWhat! would simply **overwrite both** "lessonbook.json" and "studentbook.json" with an *empty* list.
