### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

Below is a simplified diagram of the UI where the inheritance from the abstract `UiPart` class is removed. Do note that this diagram is just for ease of viewing. The actual diagram should have every component under `MainWindow` inherit from `UiPart` as above.

![Simplified Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagramSimple.png)

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a client).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="650" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
- stores the address book data i.e., all `Meeting` objects (which are contained in a `NonOverlappingMeetings` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Client` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Client` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="650" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Client features

Client features are supported by the models `Client`, `Address`, `Date`, `DateTime`, `Email`, `Name`,
`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `Note`, `Phone`, `PreferenceMap`, `UniqueClientList` and `UniquePolicyList`.

- `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` checks whether a name contains certain keywords.

- `Preference Map` allows for the recording of client preferences in a category -> preference pair.

- `UniqueClientList` allows for the adding, deleting and updating of clients while ensuring clients are unique.

- `UniquePolicyList` allows for the adding, deleting and updating of policies for each client while ensuring policies
are unique.

The `Client` model has nine attributes:

1. `name`
2. `phone`
3. `email`
4. `address`
5. `birthday`
6. `lastContacted` represents the date and time the client was last contacted at
7. `policies` represents a list of policies owned by the client
8. `note` records a note about the client
9. `preferences` records the client's preferences

Client features support the following operations:

- Adding new client - called via the `AddCommand`
- Viewing clients in the sidebar - called via the `ViewClientCommand`
- Updating clients - called via the `EditCommand`
- Deleting clients - called via the `DeleteCommand`
- Adding note to client - called via the `AddNoteCommand`
- Adding preferences to client - called via the `AddPreferenceCommand`
- Setting client last contacted time - called via the `ContactedCommand`
- Finding a client by name - called via the `FindCommand`
- Removing all clients from the client list - called via the `ClearCommand`
- Sorting clients based on various attributes - called via the `SortCommand`
- Filtering clients based on various attributes - called via the `FilterCommand`

### Last contacted features

This feature, which allows the user to track when they have last contacted a client, is enabled through the
`lastContacted` attribute of type `DateTime` in the `Client` class.

`DateTime` objects such as `lastContacted` only accept strings of the format `dd-MM-yy HH:mm`.

The `ContactedCommand` allows for the updating of the `lastContacted` of a `Client`.

Below is an example usage scenario:

Step 1. The user launches the application. `Client`s are loaded from persistent memory. If a `Client`'s `lastContacted`
has been updated previously, the datetime will show on the user interface i.e. `Last contacted: 21-03-2022 21:03`.
Otherwise, it will show `Last contacted: `.

![LastContacted1](images/LastContacted1.png)

Step 2. The user inputs `contacted 1 lc/ 21-03-2022 21:03` and presses `Enter`.

![LastContacted2](images/LastContacted2.png)

Step 3. The first client's `lastContacted` is updated to `21-03-2022 21:03`.

![LastContacted3](images/LastContacted3.png)

When creating a new `Client` through the `addClient` command, indicating their `lastContacted` through the `lc/DATETIME`
prefix is **optional**. If their `lastContacted` is not indicated, it will just be instantiated as an empty string.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Meeting features

The new meeting feature is supported by two new main models `Meeting` and `NonOverlappingMeetingList`. The relationship between `Meeting` to `NonOverlappingMeetingList` is similar to the relationship between `Client` and `UniqueClientList`.

**The `NonOverlappingMeetingList` is stored in `AddressBook` class and ensures that no two meetings overlap.

The `Meeting` model has four attributes

1. `startDateTime` represents the starting date and time of the meeting
2. `endDateTime` represents the ending date and time of the meeting
3. `client` represents the client that is being met in this meeting
4. `label` represents the description of the meeting

The meeting features supports the following operations:

- Adding new meetings - called via the `AddMeetingCommand`
- Viewing meetings in the sidebar - called via the `ListMeetingCommand`
- Editing meetings - called via the `EditMeetingCommand`
- Deleting meetings - called via the `DeleteMeetingCommand`
- Close meetings - called via the `CloseMeetingCommand`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the feature behaves:**

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `NonOverlappingMeetingList` is loaded from persistent memory if it exists and is stored in the AddressBook.

Step 2. The user executes `addMeeting 1 ms/22-04-2022 11:00 me/22-04-2022 12:00 l/Lunch` to schedule a meeting with the first client in the list on 22nd April 2022 from 11:00AM to 12:00PM for lunch. The `addMeeting` command instantiates a new `Meeting` object and calls the `Model#addMeeting()` to add the object to the `NonOverlappingMeetingList`.
![Meeting1Add1](images/Meeting1Add1.png)
The meeting has been added to the list.
![Meeting1Add2](images/Meeting1Add2.png)

Step 3. The user executes `meetings` to view the meetings on the right sidebar.  The `meetings` command calls `Model#updateFilteredMeetingList()` which displays the meetings on the dynamic panel on the right.
![Meeting2List1](images/Meeting2List1.png)

Step 4. The user executes `editMeeting 1 me/22-04-2022 14:00` to edit the meeting to set the end time to 2:00PM. The `editMeeting` command calls `Model#setMeeting()` which updates the meeting's details.
![Meeting3Edit1](images/Meeting3Edit1.png)
The meeting has been modified.
![Meeting3Edit2](images/Meeting3Edit2.png)

Step 5. The user calls `closeMeeting 1` to close the meeting. The `closeMeeting` command calls `Client#updateLastContacted()` and `Model#setClient()` to update the client's last contacted and update the client's details.
![Meeting5Close1](images/Meeting5Close1.png)
The client's last contacted has been updated to the meeting's end date time.
![Meeting5Close2](images/Meeting5Close2.png)

Step 6. The user executes `deleteMeeting 1` to delete the meeting. The `deleteMeeting` command calls `Model#deleteMeeting()` to delete the specified meeting from the list.
![Meeting4Delete1](images/Meeting4Delete1.png)
The meeting has been deleted.
![Meeting4Delete2](images/Meeting4Delete2.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Note features

The new note feature is supported by a new model `Note`. Each `Client` object contains a `Note` attribute to specify a specific `Note` that the user wishes to record about the `Client`.

The `Note` model has a single attribute

1. `value` that represents the `String` value that is stored in the note.

The note feature supports the following operations:

- Adding a note - called via the `AddNoteCommand`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the feature behaves:

Step 1: The user launches the application

Step 2: The user executes `addNote 1 nt/Likes to gym` to add a `Note` to the existing `Client` object that represents the first client in the list containing `"Likes to gym" as the value.

![Note1Add](images/Note1Add.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Preference features

The new preference feature is supported by a new model `PreferenceMap`

The `PreferenceMap` model has a single attribute. The existing `Client` model now contains a `PreferenceMap` representing all the preferences of the specific `Client`.

1. `preferences` that represents stores the key, value pairs of the preferenceKey and preferenceDetails

The preference feature supports the following operations:

- Adding of new preferences - called via the `AddPreferenceCommand`
- Deleting of existing preferences - called via the `DeletePreferenceCommand`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the feature behaves:

Step 1: The user launches the application

Step 2: The user executes `addPref 1 pk/Drink pd/Bubble Tea` to add the Drink: Bubble Tea preference to the first client in the contact list. The `addPref` command calls the `addPref` command of the existing `Client` object that represents the first client in the list, and adds the `"Drink", "Bubble Tea"` key-value pair into the preferences of the specified `Client`.

![Preference1Add](images/Preference1Add.png)

Step 3: If the user would like to remove the `"Drink", "Bubble Tea"` preference as specified in the `addPref` command in Step 2, they can execute `deletePref 1 pk/Drink` to remove the preference specified by the key `"Drink"` from the existing `Client` object represented at the index `1`.

![Preference2Delete](images/Preference2Delete.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Policy features

Policy features are supported by three new models `Policy` and `Premium`.

The `Policy` model has four attributes

1. `name` represents the name of the policy
2. `company` represents the name of the company which sells the policy
3. `policyManager` represents the name of the person who is managing the policy
4. `premium` represents the annual premium payment for the policy

Policy features support the following operations:

- Adding new policies - called via the `AddPolicyCommand`
- Editing policies - called via the `EditPolicyCommand`
- Deleting policies - called via the `DeletePolicyCommand`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the feature behaves:

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `addPolicy 1 n/Medicare Plus c/Medicare pm/Zechary $/100` to add the Medicare Plus policy to
the first client in the contact list.
- The `addPolicy` command instantiates a new `Policy` object which will be added to the `UniquePolicyList` of the
  existing`Client` object that represents the first client in the list.

![Policy1Add](images/Policy1Add.png)

Step 3. The user executes `editPolicy 1 pi/1 $/200` to update the `premium` of the first policy of the first client in the contact list from $100 up to $200.

![Policy2Edit](images/Policy2Edit.png)

Step 4. The user executes `deletePolicy 1 pi/1` to delete the first policy of the first client in the contact list.
