## **User Activity Flow**

<img src="images/OverallActivityDiagram.png" width="700" />

The image above is an activity diagram of when a User uses the application. After the User opens Unibook, the user can
choose what they want to do with the app, whether it be modifying or viewing the data. The command given then executes.
If the user has more commands to give, they can keep repeating the process. Otherwise, they can use the Exit command to
close the application.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/unibook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/unibook/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/unibook/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/unibook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands. 

The `MainWindow` of the `UI` component is composed of 3 sub-components, called views - `PeopleView`, `ModulesView` and `GroupsView`. A view refers to what a user is seeing on `MainWindow`. Only 1 view can be shown at a time. The user can switch between these views with the `list` command.

#### Views Sub-Components
![Structure of the Views Sub-Component](images/UiViewsDiagram.png)

The `Views` Sub-Components consists of 3 distinct views:

* `PeopleView`
  * Consists of the `PersonListPanel` class, which displays a list of filtered persons to the user in the form of multiple instances of `StudentCard` and `ProfessorCard`.
  * Also consists of multiple instances of `ModuleAndGroupMiniCard` which displays module codes and the group names of each group in each module to the user.
* `ModuleView`
  * Consists of the `ModuleListPanel` class, which displays a list of filtered modules to the user in the form of instances of `ModuleCard`. 
    * Each `ModuleCard` displays information on a module such as: 
      * groups in the module in the form of instances of `GroupCard`
      * students in the module in the form of instances of `StudentCard`
      * professors in the module in the form of instances of `ProfessorCard`
      * key events of the module in the form of instances of `ModuleKeyEventCard`
* `GroupView`
  * Consists of the `GroupsView` class, which displays a list of filtered groups to the user in the form of instances of `GroupCard`.
    * Each `GroupCard` displays information on a group such as:
      * members of the group in the form of instances of `StudentCard`

All classes in the `Views` Sub-Component inherit from `UiPart` abstract class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.
      
### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/unibook/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `UniBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `UniBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `UniBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/unibook/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the UniBook data
  * all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object)
    * `Person` class is abstract, a `Person` object must be either of subtype `Student` or a `Professor`
  * all `Module` objects (which are contained in a `ModuleList` object)
  * all `Group` objects (which are contained in the `Module` objects they belong to)
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Module` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/unibook/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="700" />


The `Storage` component,
* can save both UniBook data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `UniBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

The `JsonAdaptedStudent` and `JsonAdaptedProfessor` classes inherit from the abstract `JsonAdaptedPerson` class, which holds all the common fields that both classes share.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `unibook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

### Add feature
The add feature enables the user to add a module/student/professor/group/event/meeting to the UniBook depending on the option specified by the user. 

Given below is an example of a sequence diagram that shows the flow using the input `add o/module n/Software Engineering m/CS2103`.

The command is first parsed with `execute("add o/module n/Software Engineering m/CS2103", true, false, false)` where `true`, `false` and `false` are boolean variables which indicate whether the `Person` or `Module` or `Group` view is active. Following that, the `parseCommand` method in `UniBookParser` will be called, which in turn calls `AddCommandParser`. This instantiates a new `AddCommand` object which is returned to `UniBookParser`. After which, the `AddCommand` is passed to `LogicManager` and the `execute` method will run. The `model` object will be accessed to update the current list of modules in the UniBook. Finally, the `CommandResult` will be returned.

The add command can also add a group/student/professor/event/meeting. In these cases, the flow of the program is still largely similar, except that `model` object will be accessed to update the respective fields of students/professors/groups.
![Implementation of adding a module](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

### Edit feature
The add feature enables the user to edit a module/person/group/event/meeting to the UniBook depending on the option specified by the user. 

Given below is an example of a sequence diagram that shows the flow using the input `edit 1 o/person n/Alex`.

The command is first parsed with `execute("edit 1 o/person n/Alex", true, false, false)` where `true`, `false` and `false` are boolean variables which indicate whether the `Person` or `Module` or `Group` view is active. Following that, the `parseCommand` method in `UniBookParser` will be called, which in turn calls `EditCommandParser`. This instantiates a new `EditCommandDescriptor` object which is used to create a new `EditCommand` object, and returned to `UniBookParser`. After which, the `EditCommand`and returned to `EditCommand`. The`execute` method will run. Finally, the `CommandResult` will be returned and the `setPerson` method will be called to update the people list in the `model` object.

The edit command can also add a group/student/professor/event/meeting. In these cases, the flow of the program is still largely similar, except that `model` object will be accessed to update the respective fields of students/professors/groups.

![Implementation of adding a module](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)


### Delete feature
The delete feature enables the user to delete a module/student/professor/group/event/meeting/key event from the UniBook depending on the option specified by the user.

Given below is an example of a sequence diagram that shows the flow using the input `delete 1` on the people view.

The command is first parsed with `execute("delete 1", true, false, false)` where `true`, `false` and `false` are boolean variables which indicate whether the `Person` or `Module` or `Group` view is active. Following that, the `parseCommand` method in `UniBookParser` will be called, which in turn calls `DeleteCommandParser`. This instantiates a new `DeleteCommand` object which is returned to `UniBookParser`. After which, the `DeleteCommand` is passed to `LogicManager` and the `execute` method will run. There will be checks to ensure that the command is able to be done, for example, if the index provided is out of range, no person will be deleted and the error message should inform the user that their command was invalid and how it can be fixed. Every command type will access model in different ways depending on what checks need to be done and how the model needs to be accessed. In this case, the `model` object will be accessed to delete the person at that index from the UniBook. Finally, the `CommandResult` will be returned.

![Implementation of deleting a person](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)



### List feature
The list feature enables the user to customise which modules/people/groups are currently visible. As an example, the sequence
diagram below shows the flow using the input `list type/professors` which runs on the people view.

The command is first parsed with `execute("list type/professors", true, false, false)` where the boolean variables indicate whether the `People`, `Modules` or `Groups` view is currently active. Subsequently, the 
`parseCommand` method in `UniBookParser` is called which will call `ListCommandParser`, which creates the 
`ListCommand` for `ListCommandParser` to pass to `UniBookParser`. Subsequently the `ListCommand` is returned to 
`LogicManager` and the `execute` method is run. In this case the `Model` instance is accessed to update the predicate
which changes the entries appropriately (in this case showing all professors), 
before finally returning the `CommandResult`.

Note that the `List` command can also list modules or groups and in this case the flow would be very similar, just that the 
appropriate boolean variables will be flipped to represent the correct view.
