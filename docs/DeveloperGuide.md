# Setting up, getting started

Get started by following these instructions from our [guide](https://ay2122s2-cs2103-w16-4.github.io/tp/SettingUp.html).

# Design

Take a look at our design which is mostly based off [AddressBook Level 3 (AB3)](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html#design).

## Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI Component

The **API** of this component is specified in `Ui.java`

<img src="images/developer-guide/UiArchitecture.png" width="800px">

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.
The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the src/main/resources/view folder. For example, the layout of the `MainWindow` is specified in `MainWindow.fxml`
The `UI` component,
- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

Several user commands also involve the display and creation of `XYZWindows` (`matchwindow`, `statswindow`, `viewimagewindow`, `reminderwindow`, `favouritewindow`) which relies on the logic component in order to execute and display the information returned from the commands.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/developer-guide/RealEstateProModel.png" width="800px" height="800px">


The `Model` component,
* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate *filtered* list that is not exposed to outsiders.
* stores the *sorted* 'selected' `Person` objects (i.e., results of a sort operation) as a separate *sorted* list that 'observes' the *filtered* list, i.e., it updates itself whenever the data in the *filtered* list changes.
* The *sorted* list is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed', e.g., the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/developer-guide/RealEstateProStorage.png"/>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

# Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

## Property
The `Property` is a new attribute that can be added to a `Person` that represents a real estate property listing. A `Person` is able to hold multiple properties including none.

The `Property` itself consists of the following attributes: `Region`, `Address`, `Size`, `Price`.

- `Region` represents the general location of the `Address` of the `Property`. It is an enum that can be one of the following: `NORTH`, `SOUTH`, `EAST`, `WEST`, `CENTRAL`.

- `Address` represents the exact location of the `Property`.

- `Size` represents the size of the `Property` in terms of the number of rooms it has. It is an enum that can be one of the following: `ONE_ROOM`, `TWO_ROOM`, `THREE_ROOM`, `FOUR_ROOM`, `FIVE_ROOM`.

- `Price` represents the price of the `Property`. It's `toString()` method returns the price in the form of `$###` or `$###.#K` or `$###.#M` depending on the value of the `Price` for easier readability.

## Preference
The `Preference` is a new attribute that can be added to a `Person`. A `Person` can either have a `Preference` or none.

A `Preference` contains the following attributes: `Region`, `Size`, `lowPrice`, `highPrice`,
among which the first two is explained in the previous segment.
The latter two specifies the expected range of money the buyer would like to pay for a property.

## UserType
The `UserType` represents an attribute that is added to a `Person` & can represent the `Person` as a `buyer` or `seller`. A `Person` is only either a `buyer` or `seller` at a given time. They cannot be both or none. The `UserType` of a `Person` is derived from the presence of a `Property` or `Preference`. If the `Person` has a `Property`, then they are a `seller`, but if the Person has a `Preference`, then they are a `buyer`.

Unlike other attributes of a `Person`, the `UserType` of a `Person` cannot be edited _directly_ via the `edit` command. A `Person` can be changed from a `buyer` to a `seller` & vice versa if the Person's property or preference is changed. This can be done with the command: `edit INDEX pr/PROPERTY_DETAILS` or `edit INDEX pf/PREFERENCE_DETAILS`. This means editing a `Person` to have a `Property` instead of a `Preference` will change them from a `buyer` (had a `Preference` initially) to a `seller` (now has a `Property`). In other cases where other attributes of a `Person` are being edited, e.g. phone number, address, the `UserType` of that `Person` being edited will remain the same.

## Favourite/Unfavourite feature and Favourites window

The proposed Favourite mechanism will make use of a new attribute called `Favourite`. How we went about creating this mechanism is by going through the list of `Person` and checking if their `Favourite` instance returns "ðŸŒŸ" (represents favourited) when `toString()` is called.

Given below is an example of how the `favourite` mechanism behaves with the Favourites window.

Step 1. The user starts the application with pre-loaded data of `Person`.

Step 2. Assuming there is a `Person` with the index number 1 that is not favourited. User then executes `favourite 1` command to favourite the `Person` with index number 1 in the application. The system will create a new `Person` with the `Favourite` instance's value set as true. Then calls `Model#setPerson()` to set this `Person` to be the favourited instance of the same `Person`.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Note: 
If the <code>Person</code> was favourited before, calling <code>favourite</code> command on this particular <code>Person</code> will unfavourite him/her. This command will remove "ðŸŒŸ" from the <code>Person</code>. <br/> Additionally, the <code>Person</code>'s information will not show up on the Favourites window anymore.
</aside>

Step 3. User can access the Favourites window by navigating to the menu item as shown in the diagram, which pops up a new window that contains only those `Persons` that have `Favourite` instance's value set as `True`. The user can also input the command `fw` to open up the Favourites window through this CLI command.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Note: Every newly added <code>Person</code> will have the default value of <code>False</code> for <code>Favourite</code> attribute, thus will never appear in the Favourites window before the <code>favourite</code> command is called on them.
</aside>

## Match feature and Window
The `match` opens a new `MatchWindow`, in which all matches are displayed in pairs.
The left column shows the sellers, while the right column shows the buyers.

Two `Person` make a match if the seller has at least one `property` that matches the buyer's `preference`.

A property matches with a preference if
- they have the same `region`, and
- they have the same `size`, and
- the `price` of the property is between `lowPrice` and `highPrice` (inclusive) of the preference.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Help feature and Window
The `help` command and selecting help from the dropdown opens the `helpwindow`.

The contents of `helpPanePlaceHolder` is then replaced according to which tab
that the user has selected to view more details about a specific feature or general features
of RealEstatePro

## Remind feature
The remind feature is implemented by storing a static list of Persons the user wants to be reminded of.

- `ReminderTask` -- Schedules and handles the work of activating the Reminders window.
- `ReminderPersons` -- Stores a `HashSet` of `Person`s, because only 1 reminder can be set per person & thus only 1 occurrence of a Person in this data structure is allowed.
- `ReminderWindow` --  A Window to display all `Person`s the client set reminders for.
- Both `ReminderTask` and `ReminderWindow` classes are singletons as there can only ever be 1 occurrence of these classes.

The remind feature can be activated by typing `remind INDEX r/ReminderDetails` where `INDEX` is the `Person` the user wants to set a reminder for and `ReminderDetails` are the details of the reminder in regard to the specific client.

Given below is an example usage scenario and the behavior of the program specific to this feature.

Step 1: The user launches the app. After 60 seconds, a Reminder window pops up & displays any reminders the user has actively set. As the User does not have any active reminders set, they can add a reminder.

Step 2: User executes the `remind` command by typing in `remind 1 r/arrange meeting`, as the user wants to set a reminder for the client with `Index` 1. The `RemindCommandParser` parses the `Index` the `User` inputted & creates a `RemindCommand`. The `RemindCommand` is executed & retrieves the `Person` corresponding to the `Index` from `Model`. This `Person` and the corresponding `Reminder` is then added to the HashMap in `ReminderPersons`. The `CommandResult` returned is created with the input argument `showReminders` marked as true. This then gets executed by `MainWindow` and the `ReminderWindow` is launched.

Step 3: The user will be prompted with the Reminder window, containing the `Person` the user just set a `Reminder` for.

Step 4: The user can continue using the app, but after a minute since the Reminder window last popped up, the Reminder window launches again to actively remind the user of any reminders.


## Upload Image Feature
The upload image feature is implemented by storing a set of `UserImage` containing
a `FilePath` to an image file and an optional `description` of the image. A `LinkedHashSet` is utilized
to retain order based on the order of insertion.

- `UserImage` -- Contains all information needed to display the image that is associated with the Person
- `FilePath` -- Leads to a file that is located in the user's system

There are two commands that are associated with this feature, namely `upload` and `viewimage`.

Below is an example usage scenario and the behaviour of the program:

Step 1: User calls the `upload` command.
`UploadCommandParser` would then be used to parse the command inputted to obtain the `index` of the `Person` to add the image with, the `filepath` to the file (the validity of the file is checked) and the `description` if provided.

Step 2: A `UserImage` is created from the parameters obtained from `UploadCommandParser` that checks to ensure that the file `FilePath` provided is an image before adding it to the set of `UserImage` in `Person`.

Step 3: User enters the `viewimage` command that `ViewImageCommandParser` parses to get the `index` of the `Person` to view all the `UserImage` of the `Person`.

Step 4: The set of `UserImage` is then passed to `model` via `model#updateViewPerson(Set<UserImage>)`. The `viewImageWindow` is then launched after it retrieves the set from `Model` using `Logic`

Step 5: The set of `UserImage` is then converted into an `ArrayList` and the first image is displayed in the window.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Statistics feature and Window
<img src="images/user-guide/Stats.png" height="400px">

The `stats` command opens a new Statistics window that displays a pie chart with the data of the number of sellers & buyers in the 5 different regions, namely {North, South, East, West, Central}.

This allows the user to be able to visualize his/her client's data to make better business decisions. (exp. Expand the user's influence in the most popular region for any potential sellers/buyers to contact him/her)

**[Future version]** <br/>
* Displaying statistics of the number of properties being sold/bought categorized by their room size to provide insight on the most popular number of rooms in a property.
* Displaying statistics of the prices of properties sold/bought to provide insight on the average property price sold/bought.
* Displaying statistics of lower price and higher price of preferences of clients to provide insight on the average asking price of a property.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Sorting Feature

The sorting feature is implemented by using a `SortedList<Person>` to observe the `FilteredList<Person>` in `ModelManager`. Whenever the data in the list containing all `Person` objects is changed, the `FilteredList<Person>` is notified first and will filter the data. Whenever the data in the `FilteredList<Person>` changes, the `SortedList<Person>` is notified and will sort the filtered data. This allows the *sort* feature to be used in conjunction with the *find* feature, i.e., it is possible to *sort* the results found by the *find* feature.

The `SortedList<Person>` is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getFilteredAndSortedPersonList()` while the `FilteredList<Person>` is not exposed.

Comparisons between `Person` objects are facilitated by `PersonComparator` which holds a list of `Comparator<Person>`. It implements `Comparator<Person>` and compares `Person` objects using the first `Comparator<Person>` in the list, followed by the subsequent elements in the event of a tie.

Given below is an example usage scenario.

Step 1. The user launches the application. Both the `FilteredList<Person>` and `SortedList<Person>` will contain the same data as the list containing all `Person` objects.

Step 2. The user executes `find name john`, causing the `FilteredList<Person>` to only contain clients with `john` in their name.

Step 3. The user executes `sort phone` to sort the clients according to their phone number. The `sort` command calls `Model#updateSortedPersonList()`. This in turn calls `FilteredList#setComparator()` which causes the `FilteredList<Person>` to sort the data it contains.

Step 4. The user executes `list` to list all clients, which causes the `FilteredList<Person>` to now contain all clients. The `SortedList<Person>` is automatically notified and sorts the new data in the `FilteredList<Person>`. Similarly, other commands that cause the data in the `FilteredList<Person>` to change, such as `add`, `delete`,`edit`,`favourite`, will cause the `SortedList<Person>` to automatically update itself.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Feature `find` enhanced
In addition to the original `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, more predicates concerning each of the attributes in a `Person` are created.
They can be fed to the `FindCommand` to filter out `Person` with the specified keywords in the specified attribute.

This function does an OR search based on words separated by spaces. If the attribute(s) as specified by the user input 
of a `Person` contain(s) at least one of the keywords specified by the user input, this `Person` is returned.

Attributes supported are: `all` `name` `phone` `email` `address` `properties` `preference` `usertype`, 
among which `all` looks for the keywords in all other attributes. 
`property` and `preference` are converted into a string representation concatenating all their fields separating with spaces, and the string is then checked for keywords.
For all other attributes, their original string representation is used.

# Appendix: Glossary
- **Users**: Real estate agents.
- **Clients**: Customers of the real estate agents looking to buy or sell property each represented as an instance of `Person`
- **Buyers**: Clients that have engaged the real estate agent to help them buy a property.
- **Sellers**: Clients that have engaged the real estate agent to help them sell their property.

# Appendix: Requirements

## Target user profile

Real estate agents who:
- has a need to manage a significant number of clients and their information (eg. contact, email, address...)
- prefer desktop apps over other types
- can type fast and prefer typing to mouse interactions
- is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

## Value Proposition

RealEstatePro is faster that a typical mouse/GUI driven app that helps the real estate agent to
- Keep track of clients who are looking to buy and sell properties 
- Organize clients to be able to easily find their information when needed
- Buy and sell properties with greater efficiency

   3. Test case: `remind 3 r/update client's phone number`
      Expected: Unable to edit the Reminder of client, as the client does not have an existing Reminder set. Error details shown in the result display. List remains the same.
   4. Other incorrect Remind commands to try: `remind`, `remind x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size or smaller than 0).
      Expected: Similar to previous.
3. Removing a Reminder of a client who has an existing Reminder
   1. Prerequisites: List all clients using the `list` command. Multiple clients in the list. At least one of the clients listed has to have a Reminder set.

# Appendix: Effort

## Difficulty level
The development was of moderate difficulty due to having to understand the existing codebase and adapting it for our project. We also had trouble integrating the various features together especially the buyer and seller feature.

## Challenges
Challenges faced were the following:
- Understanding and refactoring the existing AB3 code base.
- Balancing the relationship between buyers, sellers, properties and preferences.
- Understanding how to use JavaFX and adapting the existing JavaFX to suit our needs.
- Integrating Java libraries such as Timer and TimerTask into the codebase.

## Effort Required
We had to research methods on how to implement the new features and think of the possible needs of real estate agents and difficulties that they face in their line of work.

## Achievements
RealEstatePro has been developed to become a fully functioning app that is capable of fulfilling the needs of a real estate agent in organising clients and is capable of
managing the different types of information that a real estate agent will need about a client.
RealEstatePro also boasts a range of tools that would improve the efficiency of the real estate agent by providing tools such as reminders and matching of clients which makes it easier to identify trends and fulfill the needs of clients.
