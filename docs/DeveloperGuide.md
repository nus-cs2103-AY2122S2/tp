### Architecture

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="341" />
</p>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/woofareyou/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/woofareyou/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />
</p>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />
</p>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/woofareyou/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PetListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Pet` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/woofareyou/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>
</p>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `PetBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a pet).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>
</p>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PetBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `PetBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/woofareyou/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="1626" />


The `Model` component,

* stores WoofAreYou data i.e., all `Pet` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePetList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Pet` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Pet>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `PetBook`, which `Pet` references. This allows `PetBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Pet` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>
</div>

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="700" />
</p>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/woofareyou/storage/Storage.java)

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />
</p>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both WoofAreYou data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `PetBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `woofareyou.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sorting feature

#### Implementation

The proposed sorting mechanism is facilitated by `SortCommand` class. It extends `Command`
and takes in a field that the user wishes to sort WoofAreYou by. The field is parsed by
`SortCommandParser`.

The primary sorting operation that takes place in the SortCommand class is sortPetList. This operation is exposed
in the `Model` interface as `Model#sortPetList()`.

Pet list can only be sorted by pet name, owner name, appointment dates, pick-up time or drop-off time. Each class implements the `Comparable` interface so that
they can be compared and sorted alphabetically.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:
![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new sort command:
![SortActivityDiagram](images/SortActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Currently the comparator classes for the sorting fields are generated
  within the `sortPetList` method in `UniquePetList`.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May be confusing to edit if there are more comparator classes in the future.

* **Alternative 2:** Generate a new package containing the various comparator classes.
    * Pros: Cleaner code. Better for future scalability.
    * Cons: Contributes to more lines of code. Harder to set up initially.


### Charge feature

#### Implementation

The proposed charge mechanism is facilitated by `ChargeCommand` class. It extends `Command`. It takes in a pet, a month with a year and the charge-per-day for that month. These fields are parsed by `ChargeCommandParser`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ChargeCommand#generateSuccessMessage()`â€‰â€”â€‰Generates a message containing the total amount chargeable to be shown to the user.
* `ChargeCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Fetches attendance details of a pet and computes a month's total amount chargeable.
* `ChargeCommand#equals()`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks if a `ChargeCommand` equates another.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the charge mechanism behaves at each step.

The user executes command `charge 1 m/04-2022 c/200` to compute total amount chargeable to the pet at index 1 in April 2022 where each day costs $200. The `charge` command is parsed by `ChargeCommandParser` which then sends the pet index, month-year and daily charge to create a new `ChargeCommand` instance.

The following sequence diagram shows how the charge operation works:

![ChargeSequenceDiagram](images/ChargeSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ChargeCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How charge executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Gets attendance from a pet's attendanceHashMap and compute charge.
    * Pros: Saves memory.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of recomputing the same pet's monthly charge.

* **Alternative 2:** Save charge as an attribute for each pet.
    * Pros: Easier to get charge.
    * Cons: Will use more memory and require more code to maintain it.


### Appointment feature

#### Implementation

The proposed appointment feature is facilitated by the `AppointmentCommand` class which extends `Command` class. The
`AppointmentCommand` takes in a valid mandatory index which specifics the pet that the command is to be used on,
followed by either **one** prefix (*clear*) or **two** prefixes (*dateTime* and *location*) based on the objective the
user is trying to accomplish. The fields are parsed by `AppointmentCommandParser` class.

Appointment feature can be used to accomplish the following 2 tasks:
1. Add and store pet's appointment details. (*dateTime and Location prefixes*)
2. Clear and delete pet's appointment details. (*clear prefix*)

The operation of updating the pet's appointment details and updating the pet filter list are done by methods in the
Model interface as Model#setPet() and Model#updateFilterPetList() respectively.

The following sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` component and `Model` component
for the `execute("app 1 clear")` API call:
![AppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/AppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new Appointmentcommand:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/AppointmentActivityDiagram.png" alt=AppointmentActivityDiagram width="600" />
</p>

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Currently the appointment command is responsible for both the adding and clearing
  of appointment details to / from a `Pet`. These 2 tasks follow a similar command format and are differentiated only
  by the prefixes / augments.
    * Pros: Easy and simple to implement.
    * Cons: User may struggle to get familiar with the command.

* **Alternative 2:** Add a new `clear` command to clear and delete contents of variables based on input field.
    * Pros: Better for future scalability.
    * Cons: Complex implementation. More lines of code. Harder to set up initially.

### Filter feature

#### Implementation
The proposed filter mechanism is facilitated by `FilterCommand` class.
It extends `Command` and takes in a field that the user wishes to filter WoofAreYou by followed by
a given filter word. The field is parsed by `FilterCommandParser`. A filter word will follow after the keyword to
indicate what the user wants to filter out specifically.

Currently, pet list can be filtered by date, owner name and tag. Users can only filter WoofAreYou by one field at
a time only. `FilterCommandParser` ensure this by throwing a `ParseException` when more than one filter field is
entered.

`FilterCommandParser` parses the arguments and classifies the fields into the three different classes as represented by
`DateContainsFilterDatePredicate`, `OwnerNameContainsFilterWordPredicate` and `TagContainsFilterWordPredicate` classes.

The class diagram below shows the relationship between the classes and `FilterByContainsFilterWordPredicate`.

![FilterPredicatesClassDiagram](images/FilterPredicatesClassDiagram.png)

Each class extends the `FilterByContainsFilterWordPredicate` class, which implements the `Predicate<Pet>` interface,
in order for `FindCommand` to handle different fields appropriately and consequently test each pet differently for a
match in the specified field.

`FindCommand` then updates the pet book using one of the three classes (`Predicates`). Each class has a different
way of testing `Pet`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works when `filter byTag/ beagle` is called:

![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `filter` command:

![FilterActivityDiagram](images/FilterActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Currently each filter field extends its own `FilterByContainsFilterWordPredicate` class.
    * Pros: Easy to implement and increases flexibility when testing using a `Predicate`.
    * Cons: May generate a lot more classes if filter fields were to expand in the future.

* **Alternative 2:** Generate a new package containing the various predicate and methods to identify different fields.
    * Pros: Cleaner code. Better for future scalability.
    * Cons: Requires more lines of code. Harder to set up initially. Risk being messy if not careful.

### Undo feature

#### Implementation

The undo mechanism is facilitated by VersionedPetBook. It extends PetBook with an undo history, stored internally as an petBookStateList and currentStatePointer. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedPetBook#commit()` â€” Saves the current WoofAreYou state in its history.
* `VersionedPetBook#undo()` â€” Restores the previous WoofAreYou state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#undo()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The VersionedPetBook will be initialized with the initial WoofAreYou state, and the currentStatePointer pointing to that single WoofAreYou state.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UndoState0.png" alt="UndoRedoState0" width="450"/>
</p>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th pet in WoofAreYou. The delete command calls `Model#deletePet()`, which in turn calls `VersionedPetBook#commit()`
causing the modified state of WoofAreYou after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the petBookStateList, and the currentStatePointer is shifted to the newly inserted WoofAreYou state.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UndoState1.png" alt="UndoRedoState1" width="450"/>
</p>

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦`  to add a new pet. The add command also calls `Model#addPet()`, which in turn calls `VersionedPetBook#commit()`
causing another modified WoofAreYou state to be saved into the petBookStateList.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UndoState2.png" alt="UndoRedoState2" width="450"/>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: Note: If a command fails its execution, it will not call 
VersionedPetBook#commit(), so the WoofAreYou state will not be saved into the petBookStateList.
</div>


Step 4. The user now decides that adding the pet was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the undo command. The undo command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the currentStatePointer once to the left, pointing it to the previous WoofAreYou state, and restores WoofAreYou to that state.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UndoState3.png" alt="UndoRedoState3" width="450"/>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: Note: If the currentStatePointer is at index 0, pointing to the initial PetBook state, then there are no previous PetBook states to restore. If so, it will return an error to the user.
</div>


The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" width="650"/>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: Note: The lifeline for UndoCommand should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command list. Commands that do not modify WoofAreYou, such as list, will usually not call `VersionedPetBook#commit()` or `Model#undo()`.
Thus, the petBookStateList remains unchanged.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UndoState4.png" alt="UndoRedoState4" width="450"/>
</p>


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />
</p>


#### Design considerations:

Aspect: How undo executes:

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Saves the entirety of WoofAreYou.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* Alternative 2: Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for delete, just save the pet being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Attendance feature

#### Proposed Implementation
The proposed attendance feature is facilitated by the two classes `PresentAttendanceCommand` and `AbsentAttendanceCommand`,
which extend the `Command` class. The commands allow users to either mark a pet as present or absent on a particular day.
Initially, user input, which includes the index of the pet, date, as well as pick-up and drop-off time (if applicable),
is parsed by the `PresentAttendanceCommandParser` or `AbsentAttendanceCommandParser` classes into the command classes above.
The command classes are then passed on to the `Model` component for execution.

During command execution, data from the user input is parsed into one of two subclasses of `AttendanceEntry` objects.
The attendance entry is then stored into `AttendanceHashMap`. A class diagram illustrating the structure of `AttendanceHashMap`
can be seen below.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/AttendanceHashMapClassDiagram.png" alt=AttendanceHashMapClassDiagram width="350" />
</p>

The `AttendanceHashMap` in pets consists of mappings of dates to `AttendanceEntry` objects. The class hence acts as an "attendance sheet",
and is the main repository of data within the Model component that facilitates `Attendance` functionalities.

The operation of updating the pet's attendance details and updating the GUI to reflect such changes are done by methods
in the Model interface as `Model#setPet()` and `Model#updateFilterPetList()` respectively. `Attendance` GUI is also
supported by the `AttendanceTag`, `TransportTag` and `AttendanceUtil` classes as well as methods.

The following sequence diagram below models the interactions between the Logic as well as the Model components to
update the backend and frontend of the application for the `absent` command.

![AbsentAttendanceSequenceDiagram](images/AbsentAttendanceSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence model follows a similar structure for the `present` command as well.

In addition, the activity diagram below illustrates the workflow of attendance commands.
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/AttendanceActivityDiagram.png" alt=AttendanceActivityDiagram width="500" />
</p>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Attendance data within `Model` component**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Attendance entries in every pet's `AttendanceHashMap`.
    * Pros: Better OOP and performance.
    * Cons: Higher memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** All attendance entries in a single HashMap.
    * Pros: Lesser memory usage, easier to implement.
    * Cons: Nested data structure, lack of OOP and separation of concerns.

## **Appendix: Effort**

## Model

WoofAreYou's `Model` draws inspiration from original [AB3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html).
However, WoofAreYou's model is more complicated because it is specifically adapted to handle `Pet` attributes instead of
just `Person` objects.

In WoofAreYou, it is crucial to keep track of pets' attendance. Hence, the `AttendanceHashMap` class in WoofAreYou is
essential for many of the functionalities. Not only does `AttendanceHashMap` need to modify the database directly to store
potentially large amount of attendance entries for each pet, it has to ensure that these data are easily retrievable.
Similarly, the `Appointment` class has to be flexible to cater to the ever-changing nature of pets' appointments.
These 2 classes utilised Java's `LocalDate`, `LocalTime` and `LocalDateTime` libraries to facilitate parsing of arguments
which saved significant amount of time in handling invalid inputs.

Complex attributes such as `Charge` were also implemented to calculate the specific cost every month for each pet. The
`Model` of WoofAreYou supports higher level features and commands like sorting, filtering and undoing to increase efficiency
that are not present in AB3.

All the different classes in WoofAreYou `Model` have to interact with one another to ensure cohesiveness and efficient
navigability for the user. For instance, filtering and sort have to access the `AttendanceHashMap` or `Appointment` class
to retrieve the relevant dates. There are many ways of implementing these commands and a lot of effort is put into
the design consideration as discussed in the previous sections.

After many rounds of refinement, the current `Model` of WoofAreYou is one of the more efficient and scalable models
catered for its purpose.

## Logic

WoofAreYou's `Logic` is more advanced than that of AB3. WoofAreYou supports many more commands such as `sort`,
`filter`, `undo`, `diet`, `app`, and the different commands for marking attendance. Existing commands of AB3 like
`edit` and `find` are also enhanced to handle the complex `Model` of WoofAreYou.

Significant effort was placed in implementing the `Logic` for WoofAreYou. It encompasses the logic for pets'
`AttendanceHashMap`, `Diet`, `Appointment` and `Charge` on top of the logic that AB3 has initially which has been adapted
for WoofAreYou.

A huge amount of time was dedicated in validating user input for different commands. This is to ensure that WoofAreYou
is user-friendly enough to support inputs that are both intuitive for users and manageable for developers. Additional
effort was put into crafting error messages to ensure smooth handling of invalid input.

## Storage

WoofAreYou's `Storage` extends that of AB3 to increase functionality and store a variety of attributes that pets may
have. `AttendanceHashMap`, `Appointment`, `Diet` and `Tags` are carefully organised and stored as separate entries in a
JSON file. Doing so ensures that these attributes are unique to each pet and can be retrieved easily for other implementations.

More time and effort were spent in crafting the JSON entries of `AttendanceEntry` as it needs to store dates that
the pet was present or absent, and also their respective pick-up and drop off timings. All these are well
encapsulated in an organised format in the JSON file for easy retrieval.

## UI

WoofAreYou's `UI` is designed to be very dependent on visual cues to enhance user-friendliness. Every command that the
user execute will be accompanied by a status message at the very least. This status message appears at the top of
WoofAreYou to help users understand what is going on after each execution. In the event of any invalid input, error
messages shown are crafted to be intuitive and easily understandable so that users can rectify their mistakes.

### Attendance Visual Cues

WoofAreYou has a dedicated column on the right to indicate a pet's attendance. A significant amount of effort is put into
the design of this feature as attendance is the crux of a daycare's operation. Different coloring of date labels
serves as visual cues for absent and present attendance entries of each pet. It is designed this way so that daycare
owners rely on WoofAreYou for any form of attendance recollection rather than on their memory.

### Appointment Visual Cues

WoofAreYou has a dedicated label for appointments that pets may have. Similarly, a lot of thought were put into its design
to allow daycare owners to rely less on memory. A great amount of effort is spent synchronising the dates with the
different color codes of the appointment label. This visual cue informs daycare owners when an appointment has already
passed, is ongoing or yet to happen.

### Diet Visual Cues

WoofAreYou also has a dedicated label for dietary requirements of pets. It is meant to emphasise any important request
that a pet may have in terms of its diet. Hence, more consideration were put into making this feature more prominent in
the GUI.

### Challenges

Since WoofAreYou handles a lot more information and data compared to AB3, the GUI may be more cluttered. In order to
make the GUI neater, more VBox and HBox components are introduced to accommodate more information displayed. This initially led to formatting
issues of certain fields like addresses or tags being truncated and the GUI being less user-friendly. Character limit
was then introduced to ensure that input will not exceed its allocated space but this led to other bugs. Eventually, a hybrid
approach of increased character limit and resizable components is currently adopted to enhance user-friendliness.


## Overall

In conclusion, WoofAreYou was a challenging project for the team. The team started off ambitiously, coming up with
features that could make a huge impact on daycare owners' lives. Unfortunately, given the limited time period, some
features had to be sacrificed for more essential ones.

The team members all put in equal amount of effort into making WoofAreYou a success. Effort levels since the first
iteration has been consistently increasing. Despite our busy schedules, all members made a conscious effort to meet
weekly and work rigorously on WoofAreYou. Pull requests were generated every other day and reviews followed shortly.
The team showed immense responsiveness when dealing with issues and worked at a very high level.

From understanding the original code, implementing new features to conducting rigorous testing, the team ensured that
every piece of work they had to do was of a high standard. With the given time constraints, the team has put in all the
effort they can to make WoofAreYou a viable and concrete product that can already be used in the industry. Although
WoofAreYou may not be perfect, there is always room for improvement and the team is proud of the end product.
