## **Introduction**

ModuleMateFinder is a desktop address-book-like application that is designed for university students. It is used to 
keep track of your friends' contacts, as well as the modules they are taking. ModuleMateFinder is optimized for use 
via the CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

This Developer Guide documents the architecture, design implementations and considerations of various 
components and features in ModuleMateFinder, and aims to allow developers to gain a deeper understanding on the 
application.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.  
Furthermore, `AddWindow` and `EditWindow` keeps a reference to `MainWindow`'s `Logic` component in order to execute commands.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.


### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions from the `Logic` component for the `execute("add")`
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add` Command](images/AddNoParamsSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Module` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Module` object per unique module, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Module` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
<br /><br />
### Add Modules Feature
#### Implementation

The add modules mechanism is facilitated by `AddModulesCommand`. Its functionality is implemented in the `AddModulesCommand.java` class which follows the `Command` interface. It extends `Command` with a list of modules `List<Module>` that is to be added to an existing person, as well as the index of the person to add the modules to, stored internally as `modulesToAdd` and `targetIndex` respectively.

Additionally, it implements the following operations: 
* `Command#execute(Model model)` - Returns the feedback message containing information about module(s) added to a target person, for eventual displays in the GUI.
* `createEditedPerson(Person personToEdit, List<Module> modulesToAdd)` - Creates and returns a Person with `modulesToAdd` added to the existing details of `personToEdit`.
* `hasModulesInCommon(Person personToEdit, List<Module> proposedModules)` - Returns true if `personToEdit` contains any modules in `proposedModules`.
* `getNewModules(Person personToEdit, List<Module> proposedModules)` - Returns List of non-duplicated modules, which may be empty if no unique modules exist.
* `getCommandResult(...)` - Returns a `CommandResult` with the appropriate feedback depending on if any new modules are added.

Below is a sequence diagram showing the overview of how add modules works:

![AddModulesSequenceDiagram](images/AddModulesSequenceDiagram.png)

Each `Person` has a `Set<Module>` that represents the Collection of `Modules` associated with that `Person`.
Hence, we utilize the behaviour of the `Set` data structure to both store and add modules to a person, automatically adding any new unique Modules while ignoring Modules that already exist, without requiring any further duplicate-checking on our part.

While this underlying implementation works, we need to capture exactly what new modules were added on top of existing modules, so that we can display a meaningful feedback to our user.
This can be achieved using the `hasNewModules()` and `getNewModules()` internal helper functions.

`getCommandResult()` of `execute()` utilizes these helper functions to create a `CommandResult` object containing varied feedback messages depending on the following possibilities:
1. Case 1: Modules from user input contain only new modules
   * Shows new modules added
2. Case 2: Modules from user input contain some new modules
   * Shows new modules added, with warning that some modules already exist
3. Case 3: Modules from user input contain no new modules
   * Shows warning that modules already exist, no new modules added, along with list of existing modules (to show the user that despite the "error", no further actions associated with typical failed commands need to be taken)
     <br /><br />
### Sort feature
#### Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by `PersonComparator`. It compares `Person` objects and stores internally the **list of fields** to be ordered on as well as the **order** on each field ("ascending" vs "descending"). 
`PersonComparator` then is passed to `Model`.

Within Model component, 'Model' then passes it into `AddressBook`, and which is then passed into `UniquePersonList` and finally to `ObservableList`. `ObservableList` then sorts itself based on the comparator.

Below is a sequence diagram showing how sort operation works:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

Within the `PersonComparator`, it compares both persons based on the first field in the **list of fields**. If they are not equivalent, it returns the result of the comparison taking into account the **order**. 
Else, it will check the next field. When there are no fields remaining, it specifies that the two persons are equivalent.

### Alternatives
#### Aspect: How to compare: `Comparator` vs `Comparable`
####1. Alternative 1 (Current)
Each field implements a `Comparable` interface.
- Pros:
    - Easier to implement.
- Cons:
    - Less flexible.
    - Passes only one `PersonComparator` into `Model`, which stores list of fields to be sorted on. 

####2. Alternative 2
Create a comparator for `Person` for each specific field to compare on and how to compare that field. Choose a list of comparators and sort model on them one by one.
- Pros: 
  - More flexibility for ways to compare each field. E.g. can compare`Module` field based on number of modules, lexicographic ordering, etc.
- Cons: 
  - More complexity for user syntax. 
  - Less encapsulation as `PersonComparator` has to know the details of `Person` fields and how it desires to sort them. 
  - Has to pass all `PersonComparator` that were chosen into `Model` one after another so less efficient.
<br /><br />

### Comment feature
#### Implementation

The comment mechanism is facilitated by `CommentCommand`. It adds a field of type `Comment` to a `Person` object. 
The `CommentCommand.java` class extends `Command` with the index of the person to add the module to and also a 
`Comment` object which holds the comment that will be given to the person. Additionally, it implements the following 
operations:
* `Command#execute(Model model)` - Returns a message that informs users on the comment that was added to the 
  specific person. 
* `generateSuccessMessage(Person personToEdit)` - Creates and returns the message that informs users if a new comment 
  was added or deleted from `personToEdit`.

Below is a sequence diagram showing how comment operation works:

![CommentSequenceDiagram](images/CommentSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
##### Aspect: How to remove a comment 
#####1. Alternative 1 (Current choice)
Similar to how `Status` was implemented, upon user input of an empty comment (i.e `comment 1 c/`), the comment of the 
person at the particular index, in this case the first person, will be removed.
- Pros: 
  - Can contain all logic related to adding and removing a `comment` all in the `CommentCommand` and 
    `CommentCommandParser` classes. 
  - Does not give the users too many commands to remember.
  - Avoid potential problems where users/reviewers expect a designated delete command for all fields, when some fields 
    cannot be just simply deleted on its own, e.g. address, name etc.
- Cons: 
  - Not consistent with how the other fields like `Module` and `Person` are removed. 
  
####2. Alternative 2 
Implement a separate command to handle the removal of `comment`.
- Pros: 
  - An empty comment command (`comment 1`) will show an error message, which is more intuitive.
- Cons: 
  - Results in excessive code duplication, as `delete` and `deletemodules` are implemented in a very similar way 
    to how a proposed `deletecomment` command will be implemented.
    <br /><br />

### GUI for Adding, Editing

#### Implementation

The GUI for `AddWindow` and `EditWindow` are done using JavaFX with SceneBuilder.  
The adding and editing mechanism is driven by the CLI commands, `add` and `edit`, and both goes through their respective `Parser`

Step 1: User input is retrieved from its respective `TextField`.  

Step 2: User input is strung together to follow the proper `Command` format, which is then passed to `Logic` to handle 
the rest of the execution.  

Step 3: `AddWindow` allows for the execution of multiple commands within a single window. Executing multiple 
commands (`status`, `addmodules`) is done by checking if the given inputs are valid. 

Step 4: If they are valid, we pass the execution to `Logic` to handle the adding of a `Person`. 

Step 5: After a `Person` is added, retrieve the last index from `PersonList`, then pass the user inputs for `status` and/or `addmodules` into `Logic` again to execute the commands

The following activity diagram shows how a `Person` with `Status` and `Module` is added when the given command is `add` or when the user opens `AddWindow`
![GuiAddActivityDiagram](images/GuiAddActivityDiagram.png)

Editing through `EditWindow` is largely similar to the above.
<br /><br />

### Undo/Redo Feature

#### Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `StackUndoRedo`. The implemented undo/redo feature would be best described as two stacks of commands that the user has performed:

- `undoStack` serves to store a "history" of the commands they have performed.
- `redoStack` is a collection of their commands that lead up to initial condition at which they started performing the undo.

The central concept is to store a stack of commands that essentially functions as a history-list of the commands. Essentially, we leverage on the stack's data structure of the which is a linear data structure that is based on the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). Based on the implementation described above, `undoStack` is populated by pushing a user's command in the application. 

Then, when the user performs an undo, the command is firstly popped from `undoStack` and used to restore previous state, and then we store that command onto `redoStack`.

`StackUndoRedo` contains 2 stacks, `undoStack` and `redoStack`. The `undoStack` and `redoStack` contain commands that are of type `RedoableCommand`. `RedoableCommand` extends Command and has the following attributes and methods.

![UndoRedo0](images/UndoRedo0.png)

When a `RedoableCommand` is being executed, the methods `saveAddressBookSnapshot(Model model)` will be called. This ensures that the current states are stored within the command.

After a command is executed, it will be added into the `StackUndoRedo`. The specific process is explained in the activity diagram below.

![UndoRedo1](images/UndoRedo1.png)

Next, when undo is being performed, `undoStack` will remove the first command in its stack and add it to `redoStack`. It will then call `RedoableCommand` `undo()` of the command that is removed. The `undo()` method will then set the model to the previous snapshot of `saveAddressBookSnapshot`. 

Likewise, when redo is being performed, `redoStack` will remove the first command in its stack and add it to `undoStack`. It will then call `RedoableCommand` `redo()` of the command that is removed. The `redo()` method will then execute the command again.

Given below is an example of a usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `StackUndoRedo` will be initialized.

![UndoRedo2](images/UndoRedo2.png)

Step 2. The user executes delete command. The delete command will be pushed into the `StackUndoRedo`.

![UndoRedo3](images/UndoRedo3.png)

Step 3. The user executes add module command to add a new module. 

![UndoRedo4](images/UndoRedo4.png)

Step 4. The user now decides that adding of module was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the undo command.

![UndoRedo5](images/UndoRedo5.png)


> <b>Note:</b> undoCommand will check if there is any command that can be undone by calling `StackUndoRedo` canUndo() method.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoRedo6](images/UndoRedo6.png)

> <b>Note:</b> The redo command will call `popRedo()` method in `StackUndoRedo`and `redo()` method in `RedoableCommand` .

Step 5. The user executes clear. Due to not being an `UndoCommand` or `RedoCommand`, it causes the `redoStack` to be cleared.

![UndoRedo7](images/UndoRedo7.png)

Step 6. User executes list command. Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`.

![UndoRedo5](images/UndoRedo7.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Implementation is easy.
  * Cons: Memory usage may cause performance issues.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command has attached logic that allows it to undo/redo by itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. just save what is being deleted).
  * Cons: Must ensure that the implementation of each command is correct. Adds a lot of complexity that may not seem justified as it is to only accomodate the undo/redo feature.

**Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use 2 stacks to store the history of the Models.
  * Pros: Implementation is easier and the logic would be much more manageable to debug.
  * Cons: Duplicated Logic.

* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo.
  * Pros: Does not need to maintain separate stacks and able to use what is in the codebase.
  * Cons: Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns are violated as `HistoryManager` would need to handle two different things._

## **Appendix: Effort**

If the effort required to create AddressBook3 is 100, we think that the effort to create ModuleMateFinder is **_at least 125_**.

Our group has put in significant effort to change the model of AB3 in order to fit the requirements of ModuleMateFinder. Furthermore, we have implemented several features that goes well with our product.  
To attest to that minimal amount effort, we have over 300 test cases, and added over 7.5k LOC.

### Notable Changes

- **Archives**
  - To ensure that users could keep their contacts list organised, we added the ability to archive their contacts.
  - As such, we had to figure the best way to change the underlying architecture of `Model` and `Storage` in order to accommodate two `AddressBook`.

- **Undo/Redo**
  - We allowed undoing and redoing commands in case users change their minds or make mistakes.
  - We had to account for the state of both `AddressBook` and `ArchiveBook`.

- **Copy**
  - As there are a lot of details being stored in ModuleMateFinder, we decided to provide a way for users to retrieve information easily from their contacts by having a `copy` command.
  - This allows users to retrieve, for example, a contact's email to their clipboard and use it to send an email to them.
  - We implemented different formats to allow different uses of copying, such as csv for excel.
- **Sort**
  - We give users the ability to sort their contacts rather than simply remaining disorganised. This has multiple benefits to the user, especially when it comes to finding ModuleMates.
  - For example, users can choose to sort by any parameter such as `Name` or `Status` as well as choose ordering. This allows them to effectively go through their contacts list.
- **Filter**
  - Rather than allowing users to use `find` to find common modules between their contacts, we decided to implement a new command, `filter`.
  - The two commands have different use cases that we did not want to mix up, so this required the addition of a new `Predicate`.
  - With respect to AB3, the `find` command could not find users by `Tag`, so this is a much needed enhancement for ModuleMateFinder.
- **Updated GUI**
  - In AB3, the GUI is very bare and plain. We altered the base UI to have a different, more relatable theme.
  - Instead of using only text to represent certain fields, we decided to use visual representations as well, such as diagrams for `status`.
  - Furthermore, we also added new windows in order to help unfamiliar users with the different commands, while ensuring that it stays optimised for fast typists.
  - Hence, we had to research and design on the best ways to optimise GUI for fast typists.
- **Test Cases**
  - Many of the test cases would not have worked with ModuleMateFinder. We had to modify many of the unit tests in order to accommodate for this.
  - We also had to add more test cases, especially for commands prone to bugs such as `Copy`.
