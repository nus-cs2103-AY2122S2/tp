### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

---

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ShowListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com//AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Show` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TrackermonParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a show).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TrackermonParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TrackermonParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the show list data i.e., all `Show` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueShowList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Show` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Show>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ShowList`, which `Show` references. This allows `ShowList` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Show` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

[return to top <img src="images/toc-icon.png" width="25px">](#table-of-contents)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both show list data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ShowListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find command feature

#### What it does 

Looks for a show in a list of shows and displays all the shows that match the user's input. If the user's input contains no prefixes, `find` will do a general search through all fields in the `Show` class.

#### Implementation
After entering the find command, the `ArgumentTokenizer` will map any prefixes in the user's input to Trackermon's prefix syntax.Then, the parser will do a check whether there are any prefixes in the input. If prefixes are specified, a `FindCommand` object will be created with predicates looking through the specified prefixes. Else, a general show predicate will be created by scanning through the name, status and tag fields of the `Show` class. `FindCommand` is a class that inherits the `Command` abstract class. `FindCommand` implements the `execute()` method from the `Command` abstract class where on execution, it will scan through the shows in the model's list of shows and check if any shows match the user's input. The model is then udpated with the filtered show list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and the step-by-step flow of the find command.

Step 1: The user launches Trackermon and is presented with a list of all shows retrieved from local storage `Trackermon.json`.

Step 2: The user executes `find t/Anime t/Action` to find a show.

Step 3: The find command will check and see whether any shows contain the tags `Anime` and `Action` using the `Model#updateFilteredShowList` method.

Step 4:
`Model#updateFilteredShowList` will be called and model will be updated without modifying the original show list. If no shows match the keywords given by the user, an empty list will be displayed.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**<br>
`find Shingeki no Kyojin` will also work, however it will scan through the name, status and tag fields instead of the name field only
</div>

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a valid find command on tags only:

<img src="images/FindSequenceDiagram.png" width="2500px">

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a valid find command:

<img src="images/FindShowDiagram.png" >

#### Design considerations:
##### Aspect: How find executes
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `find` command checks for keywords after the prefix. If there are no prefixes, it will perform a general search using `ShowContainsKeywordsPredicate` which scans through the name, status and tag fields in the `Show` class. Else, `ArgumentMultimap#arePrefixesPresent` will check and return a new predicate for each value after each prefix if it is present and then generate a keyword predicate that will match values in that field. A for loop is implemented for the name and tag predicates. This will allow an `AND` search within a list of keywords within these two parameters. The user does not need to type in the full word for any find searches as each predicate uses a fragmented search.
  - Pros: Abstraction of predicates and encapsulating the checking of shows allows the predicates to be used more flexibly elsewhere to match other shows.
  - Cons: More abstraction may make developers take a longer time to extend the functionality if new prefixes are being added.

- **Alternative 2:** Directly check whether the show is in the show list in the find command parser without a predicate.
  - Pros: Developers can easily understand the code and its functionality as all of the code is condensed in a single class.
  - Cons: Bad coding and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practices is prominent due to the lack of abstraction.

### Sort command feature

#### What it does

Sort the list of shows according user's input prefix. If the user's input contains no prefixes, sort will sort by name in ascending order. If both prefixes for ascending and descending are used, it will only sort by ascending. If both prefixes for name and status are used, by default it will sort by name then by status.

#### Implementation
After entering the sort command, the tokenizer in parser will map any prefixes in the user's input to Trackermon's prefix syntax. Then, the parser will do a check whether there are any prefixes in the input. If prefixes are specified, a `SortCommand` object will be created with `Comparator` according to the specified prefixes. Else, a `NameComparator` will be created which can be used to sort names in ascending order. `SortCommand` is a class that inherits the `Command` abstract class. `SortCommand` implements the `execute()` method from the `Command` abstract class where on execution, sort the model's list of shows according to the `Comparator`. The model is then updated with the sorted show list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and the step-by-step flow of the sort command.

Step 1: The user launches Trackermon and enters `sort sna/ ssd/` to sort the list of shows.

Step 2: The sort command parser will check for prefixes and generate the appropriate `Comparator` for the SortCommand. In this case it generate a `NameComparator().thenComparing(StatusComparator().reverse()))`

Step 3: When the sort command executes, it will call`Model#updateSortedShowList` method.

Step 4: The sorted list in model will apply the Comparator and model will be updated in order by ascending name then descending status.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a sort command:

<img src="images/SortShowDiagram.png">

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a sort command, in this case sort with no prefix:
<img src="images/SortSequenceDiagram.png">

#### Design considerations:
##### Aspect: How sort executes
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `sort` command checks for the optional prefix. If the user's input contains no prefixes, sort will sort by name in ascending order. If both prefixes for ascending and descending are used, it will only sort by ascending. If both prefixes for name and status are used, it will sort by name then by default.

  - Pros: No invalid commands input by the user
  - Cons: Users need to get use to the prefixes used.

- **Alternative 2:** The `sort` command checks for the non-optional prefix. Users have to provide valid input to specify which attribute to sort by and by ascending or descending. 
    - Pros: Users have fewer prefixes to remember
    - Cons: Users need to remember valid inputs

### Status feature

#### What it does it do
`Status` class is an attribute within the `Show` class. `Status` represents the 
watched status of the show which can be represented by `completed` and `watching`. 

#### Implementation

`Status` class is implemented as a `enum` class. Enumerations 
are a list of named constants, where the named constants are `completed` and `watching`.
It is also possible to implement `Status` as a normal class encapsulating a String or Integer which would 
represent the status of the show (`watching` & `completed`). However, the former implementation
is chosen due to certain advantages that it offers.

#### Design considerations:

1. Enumerations offer compile time type safety, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
2. Enumerations implementation would have better space complexity. With the `enum` implementation, all the shows would 
reference the same `enum` class. However, for the class implementation, a new `Status` instance is
instantiated each time a `Show` object is created.
