## **Introduction**

Trackermon is a **desktop application** for **tracking and managing shows, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the **benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. Trackermon helps people track and remember what shows they have watched, are currently watching, or plan to watch.

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the Application.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackermon/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackermon/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At application launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the Application consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the Application.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the Application in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

[return to top <img src="images/toc-icon.png" width="25px">](#table-of-contents)

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackermon/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ShowListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackermon/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com//AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Show` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackermon/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TrackermonParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a show).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TrackermonParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TrackermonParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackermon/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the show list data i.e., all `Show` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueShowList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Show` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Show>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ShowList`, which `Show` references. This allows `ShowList` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Show` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

[return to top <img src="images/toc-icon.png" width="25px">](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackermon/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both show list data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ShowListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.trackermon.commons` package.

[return to top <img src="images/toc-icon.png" width="25px">](#table-of-contents)

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find command feature

#### What it does
Looks for a show in a list of shows and displays all the shows that match the user's input. If the user's input does not contain any prefixes, `find` will do a general search through all fields in the `Show` class.

#### Implementation
<img src="images/FindSequenceDiagram.png">

After executing the `find` command, `FindCommandParser` will map any prefixes in the user's input to Trackermon's prefix syntax. It will check if there are any prefixes in the input. 
- If prefixes are specified, a `FindCommand` object will be created with predicates looking through the specified prefixes. 
- Else, a general show predicate will be created by scanning through the name, status, rating and tag fields of the `Show` class. 

Then, `LogicManager` will execute the given `findCommand` object and scan through the shows in the model's list of shows while checking if any shows matches the user's input. The model is then updated with the filtered show list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The sequence diagram below illustrates the parsing implementation of `FindCommandParser`.

<img src="images/FindSequenceReferenceDiagram.png">
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and the step-by-step flow of the find command.

Step 1: The user launches Trackermon and is presented with a list of all shows retrieved from local storage `trackermon.json`.

Step 2: The user executes `find t/Anime` to find a show.

Step 3: The `find` command will check and see whether any shows contain the tag `Anime` using the `Model#updateFilteredShowList` method.

Step 4:
`Model#updateFilteredShowList` will be called and model will be updated without modifying the original show list. If no shows match the keywords given by the user, an empty list will be displayed.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**<br>
`find Anime` will also work, however it will scan through the name, status, rating and tag fields instead of the tag field only.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a valid find command:

<img src="images/FindShowDiagram.png" >

#### Design considerations:
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `find` command checks for keywords after the prefix. 
  - If there are no prefixes, it will perform a general search using `ShowContainsKeywordsPredicate` which scans through the name, status, rating and tag fields in the `Show` class. 
  - Else, `ArgumentMultimap#arePrefixesPresent` will check and return a new predicate for each value after each prefix if it is present and then generate a keyword predicate that will match values in that field.

  A for loop is implemented for the name, status, rating and tag predicates. This will allow an `AND` search within a list of keywords within these four parameters. The user does not need to type in the full word for any find searches as each predicate uses a fragmented search.
  - Pros: Abstraction of predicates and encapsulating the checking of shows allows the predicates to be used more flexibly elsewhere to match other shows.
  - Cons: More abstraction may make developers take a longer time to extend the functionality if new prefixes are being added.<br><br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- **Alternative 2:** Directly check whether the show is in the show list in `FindCommandParser` without a predicate.
  - Pros: Developers can easily understand the code and its functionality as all the code is consolidated in a single class.
  - Cons: Bad coding and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practices is prominent due to the lack of abstraction.

### Sort command feature

#### What it does
Sorts the list of shows according to the user's input prefix. If the input does not contain any prefixes, sort will default to organizing the shows in ascending order by name. The format for sort is `sort [n/ORDER] [s/ORDER] [t/ORDER] [r/ORDER] [so/SEQUENCE]`. If two or more of the above prefixes are being used, sort will prioritise sorting by name, then status, followed by rating, and finally tags. Use `so/` to change the priority. `SEQUENCE` is the order of all the prefixes used to sort the show list, and it must contain the full names of the prefixes used.

#### Implementation
After entering the sort command, the `ArgumentTokenizer` in parser will map any prefixes in the user's input to Trackermon's prefix syntax. Then, the parser will do a check whether there are any prefixes in the input. If prefixes are specified, a `SortCommand` object will be created with `Comparator` according to the specified prefixes. Else, a `NameComparator` will be created, which can be used to sort names in ascending order. `SortCommand` is a class that inherits the `Command` abstract class. `SortCommand` implements the `execute()` method from the `Command` abstract class where on execution, sorts `Model`'s list of shows according to the `Comparator`. `Model` is then updated with the sorted show list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and the step-by-step flow of the sort command.

Step 1: The user launches Trackermon and enters `sort n/asc s/dsc` to sort the list of shows.

Step 2: The sort command parser will check for prefixes and generate the appropriate `Comparator` for the `SortCommand`. In this case it generate a `NameComparator().thenComparing(StatusComparator().reverse()))`

Step 3: When the sort command executes, it will call the `Model#updateSortedShowList` method.

Step 4: The sorted list in `Model` will apply the `Comparator` and `Model` will be updated in order by ascending name then descending status.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `SortCommand`:

After the user input the sort command, `SortCommandParser` will parse the command arguments. A map is then used to keep track of which order prefixes (`n/`, `s/`, `t/`, `r/`) are being used and also how they are being ordered. If the user uses `so/` it will reorder the Map based on the input `SEQUENCE`. Afterwards a `Comparator` is being built according the Map and passed into `SortCommand`. `SortCommand` executes and `Model` will update the list accordingly. 

<img src="images/SortShowDiagram.png">

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `SortCommand`, in this case, sort without any prefixes:
<img src="images/SortSequenceDiagram.png">

#### Design considerations:
- **Alternative 1:** The `sort` command checks for the optional prefix. If the user's input contains no prefixes, sort will sort by name in ascending order. If both prefixes for ascending and descending are used, it will only sort by ascending. If both prefixes for name and status are used, by default, it will sort by name.

  - Pros: No invalid commands input by the users
  - Cons: Users need to get used to the prefixes used.


- **Alternative 2 (current choice):** The `sort` command checks for the non-optional prefix. Users have to provide valid input to specify which attribute to sort by and by ascending or descending. 
    - Pros: Users have fewer prefixes to remember
    - Cons: Users need to remember valid inputs

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Import and Export command feature

#### What it does
Allows the user to quickly import/export existing Trackermon data for ease of updating multiple copies of Trackermon data across different platforms.

#### Implementation
When the import/export command is executed, a `JsonFileManager` is created. The `JsonFileManager` creates the File Explorer GUI using `JavaFx`'s `FileChooser` library, and handles the logic behind import/export. The user can then use the File Explorer GUI to select which file they want to import, or where they want to export Trackermon data.

For `import`: 

After the file is selected, `ImportCommand` calls the `JsonFileManager#importFile(dataPath)` method. This method overwrites the file provided in dataPath with the selected file. 
`ImportCommand` passes in the file path of the data that Trackermon is currently using. 
After the file is overwritten, `ImportCommand` returns a `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`. 
In `LogicManager`, the new data will be read and converted into an `Optional<ReadOnlyShowList>`. 
The old data is stored as another `ReadOnlyShowList`, and `Model#setShowList` is called to update `Model`'s show list with the new data if it exists. 
If the new data does not exist, the show list will not be updated. Finally, `Storage#saveShowList` is called to update the actual data file.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The sequence diagram below illustrates the interaction between `LogicManager`, `ImportCommand`, `JsonFileManager`, and `CommandResult`.

<img src="images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png">
</div>

For `export`:

After the location is selected, `ExportCommand` calls the `JsonFileManager#exportFile(dataPath)` method. 
This method writes the data file into a file at the selected location provided by dataPath. 
After the data is written into the new file, `ExportCommand` returns a `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The sequence diagram below illustrates the interaction between `LogicManager`, `ExportCommand`, `JsonFileManager`, and `CommandResult`.

<img src="images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png">
</div>

#### Design considerations:
Implementing the FileChooser library allows us to create a File Explorer GUI similar to the user's Operating System's native File Explorer GUI.

[return to top <img src="images/toc-icon.png" width="25px">](#table-of-contents)

---

### Show status

#### What it does
`Status` class is an attribute within the `Show` class. `Status` represents the watch status of the show, and can be represented by `completed`, `watching`, or `plan-to-watch`. 

#### Implementation

`Status` class is implemented as a `enum` class. Enumerations are a list of named constants, where the named constants are `completed`, `watching` and `plan-to-watch`. 

#### Design considerations:

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** 
  `Status` is implemented as a `enum` class. Enumerations offer compile time type safety, reducing the risk of runtime errors. Enumeration implementation has better space complexity. With the `enum` implementation, all the shows would reference the same `enum` static class. However, for the class implementation, a new `Status` instance is  instantiated each time a `Show` object is created.
  - Pros: Offers compile time type safety.
  - Cons: Harder to implement for people who are not familiar with `enum` class.

- **Alternative 2 :** `Status` is implemented as a regular class that encapsulates a String or Integer which would represent the status of the show (`watching`, `completed` and `plan-to-watch`). 
  - Pros: Easier to implement as it is what most people are more familiar with.
  - Cons: Lack of compile time safety.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Suggest command feature

#### What it does

Returns a single show from the current displayed list of shows

#### Implementation

After executing the `suggest` command, Trackermon creates a `SuggestCommand` object.
Then, `LogicManager` will execute the given `SuggestCommand`. Upon execution of the `SuggestCommand`'s execute method,
it will obtain the currently displayed list of shows via the `Model#getFilteredShowList` method.

In the event that the list is empty, an error message will inform users that
there are no shows currently in the displayed show list. Similarly, if there is only one show 
present in the list, it will inform the user that there is only one show in the currently displayed 
show list. 

A random show is then selected from the list of displayed shows and a `SameShowPredicate` is constructed using said show.

The random show is then displayed in the show list using the `Model#updateFilteredShowList` and the `SameShowPredicate` as its parameter.

Below is the example usage scenario and the step-by-step flow of the suggest command.

Step 1: The user launches Trackermon and is presented with a list of all shows retrieved from
local storage `trackermon.json`.

Step 2: The user executes the suggest command to get a random show from the currently displayed 
list of shows.

Step 3: The suggest command will then check to ensure that the currently displayed list of shows
contains two or more shows.

Step 4: In the event that there are no shows or only one show currently being displayed, Trackermon will return 
an error message. Else, a random show will then be selected from the currently displayed list 
of shows.

Step 5: `Model#updateFilteredShowList` will then be called and `Model` will be updated with the 
selected show.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations:

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Returns a random show from the currently displayed list.
  - Pros: - Simple and easy to use.
  - Cons: - If the user wants to get another suggestion, they have to call the list command to get a full list of shows again.

- **Alternative 2 :** Returns a random show from the list of all shows currently in Trackermon.
  - Pros: - If the user wants to get another suggestion, they can just call suggest another time.
  - Cons: - Users are unable to get a suggestion from a filtered list of shows.
