### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackbeau/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackbeau/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletec 1,2`.

![Structure of the UI Component](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackbeau/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagramV2.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `XYZListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackbeau/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Customer`, `Service`, `Booking` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackbeau/logic/Logic.java)

![Logic Class Diagram](images/LogicClassDiagramV2.png)

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TrackBeauParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCustomerCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g., to add a customer).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletec 1,2")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletec 1,2` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackbeau/model/Model.java)

![Model Class Diagram](images/ModelClassDiagramV2.png)


The `Model` component,

* stores TrackBeau's data i.e., all `UniqueListItem` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `UniqueListItem` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<UniqueListItem>` that can be 'observed' e.g., the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


The class diagram below shows more details regarding `Customer`, `Service` and `Booking` classes in the `Model` component.

![Model Specific Class Diagram](images/ModelSpecificDetailsClassDiagram.png)



### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackbeau/storage/Storage.java)

![Storage Class Diagram](images/StorageClassDiagramV2.png)


The `Storage` component,
* can save both TrackBeau data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TrackBeauStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.trackbeau.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Customer Attributes

#### Add new data fields relevant to customers at beauty salons

##### Overview
- Data fields such as birthday, sign-up date, skin type, hair type, allergies, preferred staff and services are to be added.

##### Implementation
- Allergies, Staff and Services were added as tags as one customer can have multiple of these data fields
- The rest were added as attributes

##### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement only allergies,staffs and services as tags
    * Pros: Harder to implement
    * Cons: Less direct to access allergies, staffs and services as compared to if a list was used

* **Alternative 2:** Implement all additional fields as tags
  itself.
    * Pros: Easy to implement
    * Cons: Could be harder to access the necessary data for other functions like creating summary statistics
    * Cons: Does not make sense to have multiple of certain data fields, e.g. multiple skin types, multiple birthdays


### Add customer feature


#### Overview
The Add Customer feature is used to add customer profiles into TrackBeau. `Name`, `Phone`, `Address`, `Email` and 
`RegistrationDate` fields are compulsory.

#### Implementation of feature
The add customer feature is implemented via `AddCustomerCommand` which is created from `AddCustomerCommandParser`.
1. `AddCustomerCommandParser` takes in the argument string and parses it into an `ArgumentMultimap` that contains all the different data fields mapped to their respective prefix.
2.  The information in the `ArgumentMultimap` is then used to create a `Customer`
3.  A `AddCustomerCommand` containing the `Customer` is returned, to be executed by `LogicManager`
4.  If the `Customer` to be added is unique and does not exist in TrackBeau, it will be added. If not, a `CommandException`
    is thrown

The following sequence diagram shows the interaction within the `Logic` and `Model` components when the user inputs `addc n/Alex p/90211201 e/ale@gmail.com a/Chuang Road 113 rd/10-04-2022` command.

![Add Customer Sequence Diagram](images/AddCustomerSequenceDiagram2V2.png)

![Add Customer Sub-Sequence Diagram](images/AddCustomerSequenceDiagramV2.png)

### List customers feature

#### Overview
The list customers feature allows the user to view all the customers in TrackBeau.

#### Implementation of feature
The list customers feature is implemented via `ListCustomersCommand`.
1. The `ListCustomersCommand` calls `model#updateFilteredCustomerList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_CUSTOMERS)`.
2. The `FilteredList<Customer>` in model will then be updated to have all the customers in TrackBeau.
3. The Ui will then be updated with the latest `FilteredList<Customer>` automatically due to the underlying data structure of the customer list (`ObservableList`).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 

the source of `FilteredList<Customer>` is `UniqueList`, a data structure that stores all the items of a list.
The `UniqueList` uses Java's generics and contains items that implements the `UniqueListItem` interface (the class diagrams are shown in [Model Component](#model-component)).  

</div>

#### Design considerations
* **Option 1:** Do not abstract the common functionalities.
    * Pros: Each member can being working on their own implementation of UniqueList (e.g., UniqueCustomerList, UniqueBookingList, UniqueServiceList) immediately and independently.
    * Cons: Violates Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle and results in huge chunk of repeated code and functionality.
* **Option 2 (Current choice):** Abstract the common functionalities of the different types of unique list into one generic `UniqueList` class.
    * Pros: Makes use of the DRY principle which prevents duplication of codes.
    * Pros: Reduces total man-hours required to create each individual unique list.
    * Cons: Requires `UniqueList` to be implemented first before members working on the different types in TrackBeau (Customer/Booking/Service) can start implementing a unique list.


### Delete customer(s) feature

#### Overview
The delete command allows users to delete multiple customers at once for fast removal of unwanted customer profiles.

#### Implementation of feature
The delete customers feature is implemented via `DeleteCustomerCommand` which is created from `DeleteCustomerCommandParser`.
1. The `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` takes in the argument string and verify if the indexes in the string are all valid integers.
2. The indexes are then passed as a list to create a `DeleteCustomerCommand`.
3. When executing `DeleteCustomerCommand`, it will check if all indexes are within the bound of the size of customers list and there are no duplicated indexes.
4. The command will only success if all the check passes, else the execution will be aborted and an error will be thrown.

#### Design Considerations

* **Option 1:** Does not abort command when an index fail the check and delete customer from valid indexes.
  * Pros: Lenient on user error.
  * Cons: User might be confused of the intended behavior of the command where different inputs can produce the same effect.
  * Cons: Difficult to decide what errors should be allowed and not allowed.
* **Option 2 (Current choice):** Only if all indexes pass the check, then command with be executed.
  * Pros: Straightforward to implement.
  * Pros: It is clear about how the command is intended to be used.
  * Cons: Minor error in the input will cause the whole command to be aborted.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the delete customer command (`deletec`):

![Delete Customer(s) Activity Diagram](images/DeleteCustomerActivityDiagram.png)


### Find customers feature

#### Overview
The find customer feature allows users to show customers whose data field matches keyword.
Finding customer must have 1 or more of the data fields `Name`, `Phone`, `Address`, `Email`, `HairType`, `SkinType`,
`RegistrationDate`, `BirthDate`, `StaffPreference`, `ServicePreference`, `Allergy`

#### Implementation of feature
The find customers feature is implemented via `FindCustomerCommand` and `CustomerSearchContainsKeywordsPredicate` which is created from `FindCustomerCommandParser`.
1. `FindCustomerCommandParser` takes in the argument string and parses it into an `ArgumentMultimap` that contains all the different data fields mapped to their respective prefix.
2. The information in the `ArgumentMultimap` is then used to create a `PrefixArr` that contains search data field by indexes.
3. The information in the `PrefixArr` is then used to create a `CustomerSearchContainsKeywordsPredicate`
5. The information in the `CustomerSearchContainsKeywordsPredicate` is then used to create a `FindCustomerCommand`
7. If the input keyword in a specific data field matches a Customer's data field, the `FilteredList<Customer>` in model will then be updated to have the customer shown in TrackBeau.

#### Design considerations
* **Option 1:** Do not abstract the common parserUtil call and each data field must go through their own implementation method of parser in parserUtil independently.
    * Pros: Straightforward to implement.
    * Cons: Violates Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle and results in huge chunk of repeated code and functionality.
* **Option 2 (Current choice):** Abstract the common parserUtil call and iterate through a stored parse methods in a list.
    * Pros: Makes use of the DRY principle which prevents duplication of codes.
    * Cons: Nesting is used to prevent DRY.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the add customer command (`findc`):

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions within components when the user inputs `findc n/Alex Jane` command.

![Find Customer(s) Sequence Diagram](images/FindCustomerSequenceDiagram.png)

### Add service feature

#### Overview
The add service feature allows users to add services into TrackBeau.
Each new service must have the data fields `ServiceName`, `Price` and `Duration`.

#### Implementation of feature
The add service feature is implemented via `AddServiceCommand` which is created from `AddServiceCommandParser`.
1. `AddServiceCommandParser` takes in the argument string and parses it into an `ArgumentMultimap` that contains all the different data fields mapped to their respective prefix.
2. The mapped data fields (stored as string) are then parsed to create it with the actual data type it should be.
3. The parser then use the data fields to create a `Service` object which is then used to create `AddServiceCommand` object.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the add service command (`adds`):

![Add Service Activity Diagram](images/AddServiceActivityDiagram.png)

### Edit service feature

#### Overview
The edit service feature allows users to edit existing services in TrackBeau.
For each edit, at least one of the data fields `ServiceName`, `Price` and `Duration` must be modified.

#### Implementation of feature
The edit service feature is implemented via `EditServiceCommand` which is created from `EditServiceCommandParser`.
1. `EditServiceCommandParser` takes in the argument string and parses it into an `ArgumentMultimap` that contains all the different data fields mapped to their respective prefix.
2. The index of the service to be edited is parsed into `Index` which is used to locate the service to be modified during the execution of the command.
3. The mapped data fields (stored as string) are then parsed to create it with the actual data type it should be.
4. The parser then use the data fields to create an `EditServiceDescriptor` that describes all the edited data fields.
5. The parser then creates a `EditServiceCommand` object using the `Index` and `EditServiceDescriptor`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the edit service command (`edits`):

![Edit Service Activity Diagram](images/EditServiceActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions within the `Logic` and `Model` components when the user inputs `edits 1 pr/100` command.

![Edit Service Sequence Diagram](images/EditServiceSequenceDiagram.png)

### Plot feature

#### Overview
The plot command allows users to view customer information easily. They can plot charts about customer's allergies, 
preferred staffs, suggested services, hair type, skin type and monthly customers gained.

#### Implementation of feature
The plot feature is implemented using the various plot commands such as `plotStaffChartCommand`.
1. `MainWindow` takes in the argument string and uses `LogicManager` to parse it into `Command`.
2. `LogicManager` then executes the `Command` to obtain a `CommandResult`
3. `MainWindow` checks if the `CommandResult` should result in a chart being plotted using isPlotXYZChart() where XYZ 
   refers to a chart type, like isPlotStaffChart()
4. `MainWindow` then updates the data in the chart and shows the chart window.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the plot command (`plot`):

![Plot Chart Sequence Diagram](images/ChartSequenceDiagram.png)

### Schedule view feature

#### Overview
The schedule command allows users to view a selected week's bookings. 
They will be displayed in columns organised from Monday to Sunday, company by their corresponding date.

#### Implementation of feature
The schedule feature provides three commands to navigate to different week, `ScheduleCommand`, `ScheduleNextCommand` and `SchedulePreviousCommand`.
1. The schedule panel will display the week that contains the selected date, by default the selected date is set to the date everytime user starts up the application.
2. The selected date is store inside the `ModelManager`, and the schedule commands will manipulate this date.
3. `ScheduleCommand` sets the selected date to be the same as use input. 
4. `ScheduleNextCommand` adds 7 days to the selected date, while `SchedulePreviousCommand` minus 7 days.
5. The `SchedulePanel` will use the date stored in `Model` and find the Monday date if the date is not on Monday. 
6. Using the date, `SchedulePanel` will filter the list of bookings sequential from Monday to Sunday and display the desired week's schedule.

#### Design considerations
* **Option 1:** Filter the bookings of Monday to Sunday in parallel using Java threads.
    * Pros: Better performance specially when the number of bookings becomes huge.
    * Cons: Need some form of synchronization so that Monday to Sunday list in display in correct order.
* **Option 2 (Current choice):** Filter the bookings' day by day in a sequential order.
    * Pros: Straightforward to implement.
    * Cons: When booking data grow large, it might take longer to load the view.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the schedule command (`schedule`):

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
* works in beauty salon
* has a need to manage a significant number of customer profiles
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:
With many customers, it is hard for beauty salons to provide personalized customer service.
Our product allows the user to keep track of customer information to better understand their customer demographics.
This allows them to provide targeted services for customers as they return.
It can also keep track of performance metrics, like total new customers.
