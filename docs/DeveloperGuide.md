## **Design**

### Architecture
![Architecture Diagram of the Tinner](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)
The Architecture Diagram given above explains the high-level design of the Tinner. Tinner follows a multi-layered architecture where the lower layers are independent of higher layers. For example, `Main` can use methods found in `Storage` but not the other way around.
Below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tinner/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tinner/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteCompany 1` when in project view.

![Sequence Diagram of the deleteCompany](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI Component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tinner/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CompanyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `CommandBox` and `ResultDisplay` appear at the top of the application for the user
to interact with the application.

The `CompanyListPanel` appears at the center of the application displaying key information of `Company`
from `CompanyCard`.

The `RoleListPanel` appears at the bottom of `CompanyCard` displaying key information of `Role` from `RoleCard`.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the `MainWindow` is specified in `MainWindow.fxml`

The `UI` component,
* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the `UI` can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Company` and `Role` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic Component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tinner/logic/Logic.java)


### Model Component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

Breakdown of the Company and RoleManager packages:

![Structure of the Company and RoleManager Classes](images/CompanyRoleManagerClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tinner/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component,

* stores the company list data i.e., all `Company` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCompanyList` object).
* stores the currently selected `Company` and `Role` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate filtered list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList` that can be ‘observed’ e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
### Storage Component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tinner/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `JsonAdaptedCompany` objects in `JsonSerializableCompanyList` in json format and read it back.
* can save `JsonAdaptedRole` objects in `JsonAdaptedCompany` in json format and read it back
* inherits from both `CompanyListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`,meaning that it can be
  treated as either one (if the functionality of only one is required)
* depends on classes like `Company` and `Role` in the `Model` component (as it is the `Storage` component's
  job to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

The `JsonAdaptedCompany` also contains a list of roles in `List<JsonAdaptedRole>` format, as show in the class diagram above.

### Common Classes

---
## **Implementation**

### Find feature

The `find` feature allows users to filter the company list by specifying company name keywords and role name keywords.

#### Implementation
The `find` command is primarily implemented by `FindCommandParser` a class that extends `Parser`, and `FindCommand`, which is a class that extends `Command`. For each `find` command, a `Predicate<Company>` object and a `Predicate<Role>` object will be created. Both `Predicate` objects contain a `test` function to determine whether the given company or role matches the keywords provided in the user input.

* Upon a valid user's input using the `find` command, the `FindCommandParser#parse()`creates a `CompanyNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` which extends `Predicate<Company>`, and a `RoleNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` which extends `Predicate<Role>`.
* The `FindCommandParser#parse()` then uses the `CompanyNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object and the `RoleNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object to instantiate the `FindCommand`.
* Then invoking the `FindCommand#execute()` method will update the `model` using the `Model#updateFilteredRoleList()` method, displaying only companies and roles that match the user input.


![UML diagram of the Find feature](images/FindDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `find` command operation works with the user input `find c/meta r/software mobile`:

![UML diagram of the Find feature](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

Note that the lifeline of FindCommandParser should end at the destroy marker but due to the limitations of PlantUML, we are unable to depict it.

1. The user will first enter the input `find c/meta r/software mobile`, the `CompayListParser#parseCommand()` method will parse the information `c/meta r/software mobile` to `FindCommandParser` using the method `parse()` based on the keyword `find`.
2. The `FindCommandParser#parse()` method will create a `CompanyNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object with the company name keywords specified after the prefix `c/` and the role name keywords specified after the prefix `r/`. The `RoleNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` is also created using the role name keywords specified after the prefix `r/`. If a prefix is present, keywords that follow the prefix must be present or else it would be deemed an invalid command.
3. Note that the `CompanyNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` is created using both company name keywords and role name keywords because companies are only displayed if they contain at least one role which matches the role name keywords
4. Either prefix `c/` or `r/` can be absent. Both cannot be absent within the same command or else it would give rise to an invalid command. If absent, an empty array is passed as input in the creation of either or both `CompanyNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `RoleNameContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
5. Then the `FindCommandParser#parse()` method will create an `FindCommand` object with the `CompanyNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object and the `RoleNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object. 
6. The `FindCommand` object will be returned to the `LogicManager` and will then invoke the `FindCommand#execute()` method to implement the changes.
7. The `Model#updateFilteredRoleList()` is invoked and filters the list of companies to display only companies which match the company name keywords.
8. Similarly, the `Model#updateFilteredRoleList()` also filters the list of roles within each company to display only roles which match the role name keywords.  
9. Upon successful operation, a new `CommandResult` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

### Edit role feature
The `editRole` command for the `Role` item allows the user to update any fields by specifying
the company index, role index and prefixes of the fields to be updated.

#### Implementation
The `editRole` command is primarily implemented by `EditRoleCommandParser` a class that extends `Parser`, and `EditRoleCommand`, which is a class that extends `Command`. The `EditRoleCommand` has an inner class `EditRoleDescriptor` that holds the changes to the `Role`.

* Upon a valid user's input using the `editRole` command, the `EditRoleCommandParser#parse()`
  creates an `EditRoleDescriptor` with the edited changes to the `Role` fields.
* The `EditRoleCommandParser#parse()` then use the `EditRoleDescriptor` object to instantiate the `EditRoleCommand`.
* Then invoking the `EditRoleCommand#execute()` method will update the `Role` with the new changes.


![UML diagram of the EditRole feature](images/EditRoleDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `editRole` command operation works with the user input `editRole 1 1 d/react js`:

![Sequence diagram of the EditRole feature](images/EditRoleSequenceDiagram.png)

1. The user will first enter the input `editRole 1 1 d/react js`, the `CompayListParser#parseCommand()` method will parse the information `1 1 d/react js` to `EditRoleCommandParser` using the method `parse()` based on the keyword `editRole`.
2. The `EditRoleCommandParser#parse()` method will create an `EditRoleDescriptor` object with all the non-empty fields with the fields' prefixes that are specified by the user such as `s/`,  `b/`, `d/`, etc. In this example, `EditRoleDescriptor#setDescription()` will be used as the description `d/` is a non-empty field with `react js`.
3. Then the `EditRoleCommandParser#parse()` method will create an `EditRoleCommand` object with the company index `1`, role index `1` and the `EditRoleDescriptor` object.
4. The `EditRoleCommand` object will be returned to the `LogicManager` and will then invoke the `EditRoleCommand#execute()` method to implement the changes.
5. The  `EditRoleCommand#execute()` will check the validity of both the indexes, and invoke the `Model#setRole()` method.
6. The  `Model#setRole()` with the company index will set the role to be edited with a new role containing the changes. Then the `Model#updateFilteredRoleList()` filters the list of roles such that the application only displays the edited `Role` to the User.
7. Upon successful operation, a new `CommandResult` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.
