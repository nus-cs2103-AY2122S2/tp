### <a id="Architecture"></a>3.1. Architecture

<img src="images/Arch.png" width="500" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#UI): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#Logic): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#Model): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#Storage): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete -c 1`.

<img src="images/ArchSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* Defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### <a id="UI"></a>3.2. UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `AppointmentListPanel`, `InsuranceListPanel`, `RecordListPanel`, `ExpiredRecordPanel`, `ObejctDetailedPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.
* Does not replace the right panel - `AppointmentListPanel` at any time.
* Based on the user commands, left panel changes accordingly. e.g. when `list -r` is entered, `RecordListPanel` will replace the existing panel.
* Listens for user click on `PersonListPanel` and will update the `ObjectDetailedPanel` to show respective client's information.


### <a id="Logic"></a>3.3. Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a client).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete -c 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -c 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### <a id="Model"></a>3.4. Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="1200" />


The `Model` component,
* stores different kinds of  address book data i.e., all `Person`, `Appointment`, `Record`, and `Insurance` objects (which are contained in an `UniquePersonList`, an `UniqueAppointmentList`, an `UniqueRecordList` and an `UniqueInsuranceList` respectively).
* for example, stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change. The same mechanism applies to `Appointment`, `Record`, and `Insurance` objects as well.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model (containing `Person` object only for simplicity) is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### <a id="Storage"></a>3.5. Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save address book data, insurance book data, record book data, appointment book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage`, `InsuranceBookStorage`, `RecordBookStorage`, `AppointmentBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* note that for history related features will only read from existing storage and will not create new json file. For example, list expired record command will search in RecordBookStorage to find expired records.

### <a id="Common"></a>3.6. Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## <a id="Implementation"></a>**4. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### <a id="SortRecords"></a>4.1. Sort Records Feature

#### Implementation

The Sort Records Feature is facilitated by `SortRecordCommand`. It extends `Command` with its own execution logic. It supports the following commands:

* `sort -r sa`â€‰â€”â€‰Sort the records by start date in ascending order.
* `sort -r sd`â€‰â€”â€‰Sort the records by start date in descending order.
* `sort -r ea`â€‰â€”â€‰Sort the records by end date in ascending order.
* `sort -r ed`â€‰â€”â€‰Sort the records by end date in descending order.

These commands will be parsed by the `AddressBookParser` and `SortReocrdCommandPasrser`. `ModelManger` will override `sortRecordBook()` from `Model` which take in an `Comparator<Record>` object as input. Then `ReocrdBook` will sort the `UniqueRecordList` base on the Comparator given.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Sort Records Command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `sort -r sa` command to sort the records by start date in ascending order.

Step 2. The `LogicManager` receives the input from `UI#MainWindow` and calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, causing the user input being parsed and an object of `SortRecordCommand` returns.

Step 3. `LogicManager` executes object of `SortRecordCommand`. `SortRecordCommand` will invoke `ModelManager#sortRecordBook()` with different Comparator base on user input.

Step 4. `ModelManger` will invoke `RecordBook#sortRecord()` with the comparator as input to sort the `UniqueRecordList`.

Step 5. `MainWindow` will update the `RecordListPanel` with sorted `ObservableList` of records.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How sort records stored:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the sorted records to RecordBook.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: The original order of record list is not preserved.

* **Alternative 2:** Creates a temporary sorted records List.
  * Pros: The original order of record list is preserved.
  * Cons:  May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

### <a id="SortAppointments"></a>4.2. Sort Appointments Feature

#### Implementation

The Sort Appointments Feature is facilitated by `SortAppointmentCommand`. It extends `Command` with it own execution logic. It supports the following commands:

* `sort -a a`â€‰â€”â€‰Sort the appointments by appointment time in ascending order.
* `sort -a d`â€‰â€”â€‰Sort the appointments by appointment time in descending order.

These commands will be parsed by the `AddressBookParser` and `SortAppointmentCommandPasrser`. `ModelManger` will override `sortAppointmentBook()` from `Model` which takes in an `Comparator<Appointment>` object as input. Then `AppointmentBook` will sort the `UniqueAppointmentList` base on the Comparator given.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Sort Appointments Command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `sort -a a` command to sort the appointments by time in ascending order.

Step 2. The `LogicManager` receives the input from `UI#MainWindow` and calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, causing the user input being parsed and an object of `SortAppointmentCommand` returns.

Step 3. `LogicManager` executes object of `SortAppointmentCommand`. `SortAppointmentCommand` will invoke `ModelManager#sortAppointmentBook()` with the stated Comparator base on user input.

Step 4. `ModelManger` will invoke `AppointmentBook#sortAppointment()` with the comparator as input to sort the `UniqueAppointmentList`.

Step 5. `MainWindow` will update the `AppointmentListPanel` with sorted `ObservableList` of appointments.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: What is a good sorting order to use:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorts solely based on appointment date and time.
    * Pros: Makes more sense for the target user as appointments are time-sensitive.
    * Cons: Users have limited option of sorting order.

* **Alternative 2:** Sorting options for each attribute of appointment.
    * Pros: More flexible sorting options.
    * Cons:  Sorting by other attributes might not be useful and not even used frequently.

Moreover, design considerations for sort record command also apply here.

### <a id="ListHistory"></a>4.3. List history feature

#### Implementation
There are 2 commands in the history features, one for listing appointment history and one for expired records:
The feature is facilitated by:
* `ListAppointmentHistoryCommand` which extends `Command`, for listing appointment history. 
The command format is `list -h`.
* `ListExpiredRecordsCommand` which extends `Command`, for listing expired records. The command format is `list -e`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list appointment history command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `list -h` command to list the appointment history.

Step 2. The `LogicManager` receives the input from `UI#MainWindow` and calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, causing the user input being parsed and an object of `ListAppointmentHistoryCommand` returns.

Step 3. `LogicManager` executes object of `ListAppointmentHistoryCommand`. `ListAppointmentHistoryCommand` will invoke `ModelManager#getAppointmentHistoryBook()`.

Step 4. `ModelManger` will invoke `AppointmentHistoryBook#getAppointmentHistoryList()`.

Step 5. `MainWindow` will update the `AppointmentListPanel` with appointment histories.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to store the appointment history data:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a temporary appointment history list.
    * Pros: Saves storage.
    * Cons: Harder to implement as separate methods has to be created to check passed appointments everytime the application is launched.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves the appointment history to a separate json file.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Code is longer and harder to maintain.

**Note**: how list expired records behaves and its design considerations are the same as list appointment history

### <a id="Click"></a>4.4. Click event feature

#### Implementation

The `objectListPanel` will be updated according to user command. It supports the following commands:

* `list -c`â€‰â€”â€‰List all clients.
* `list -i`â€‰â€”â€‰List all insurances.
* `list -r`â€‰â€”â€‰List all records.
* `list -e`â€‰â€”â€‰List all expired records.
* `list -h`â€‰â€”â€‰List all passed appointments.
  
The content in `detailPane` will be updated with details of the object base on the click event.

![MainWindow](images/MainWindow.jpg)

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `list -c` command to list all clients.

Step 2.  Then `personListPanel` (filled by `ObservableList` of client) will be added into `objectListPanel` as children component.

Step 3. User click on `Davia Li`, then `PersonDetailCard` (filled by the detail information of `Davia Li`) will be added into `detailPanel` as children component.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to arrange all components:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Update the panel base on command and click event.
  * Pros:
      1. The UI looks more clean and clear.
      2. The cells of `objectListPanel` only contains important information like client name and tags.
  * Cons: User needs to click on certain cell to look into details.

* **Alternative 2:** Display everything with details(client and records information) in the `objectListPanel`.
  * Pros: User does not need to click to look into details.
  * Cons: All information are squeezed together and the list can only contain a maximum of 3-5 cells.
  User needs to scroll down to check other items in the list.

### <a id="AddRecord"></a>4.5. Add Records Feature

#### Implementation

The Add Records Feature will be facilitated by `AddRecordCommand` which implements `Parser` and `AddCommand` which extends `Command`. 

The command format is `add -r c/ClientIndex i/InsuranceIndex sd/StartDate ed/EndDate` - add a record to the client at `ClientIndex` with insurance of `InsuranceIndex` valid from `StartDate` to `EndDate`

The relevant methods are:

1. `AddCommandParser#parse(List<Person> personList, ObservableList<Insurance> insuranceList,
   String args)` --> Parse the relevant detailed information 
   
2. `AddCommand#execute(Model model)` --> Checks for duplication , validate each information and store to library

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the AddCommand behaves at each step.

Step1. The user launches the application and executes `add -r c/1 i/1 sd/22-03-2022 ed/ 22-03-2032`

Step2. The `LogicManager` receives the input from `UI#MainWindow` and calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, 
and determine that it is an Add Command.

Step3. AddCommandParser would check if the `ClientIndex` and `InsuranceIndex` exist in the library. Then it will continue to check if the `StartDate` is before the `EndDate`

Step4. Execution of Add would take place and the result will be updated in the filtered record list Model.

Important Features to take note:

1. The `add record` command takes in the `ClientIndex` and `InsuranceIndex` but stores the Client's `Name` and Insurance's `Title` in the RecordBook.
2. The `sd/STARTDATE` entered must strictly be before the `sd/ENDDATE`, else `ParseException` will be thrown

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to add record to recordBook:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User inputs all required information at once
    * Pros:
        1. Faster response rate as system does not need to prompt and wait for the user to key in the information needed.
        2. Users, who are fast-typers, can enter information at once, increasing efficiency.
    * Cons: More prone to typo errors.


* **Alternative 2:** System prompts and user input information one at a time
    * Pros: Easier for user to view their input, reducing typing errors.
    * Cons: Less responsive as user needs to wait for the system to validate the information entered one at a time before prompting the user to key in the next information.

### <a id="FindAppointments"></a>4.6. Find Appointments Feature

#### Implementation

The Find Appointments Feature will be facilitated by `FindAppointmentCommand` which extends `Command` with its own execution logic, the following command is supported:
* find -a KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]

This command will be parsed by the `AddressBookParser` and then handled by the `FindAppointmentCommandParser`, which then returns an executable FindAppointmentCommand if the input is valid.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `FindAppointmentCommand` is processed at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `find -a Bugis`

Step 2. The LogicManager receives the input from `UI#MainWindow` and calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, and determines that it is a command related to `Appointment`.

Step 3. The inputs are directed to `AddressBookParser#parseAppointmentCommand` where the `FindAppointmentCommandParser` is invoked.

Step 4. A `FindAppointmentCommand` object is returned to `LogicManager`, it then gets executed where `ModelManager` will update the `filteredAppointmentList` using the keyword.

Step 5. `MainWindow` will update the `AppointmentListPanel` to show the appointments whose description contains the keyword.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to filter the appointment list:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Finds appointments by keyword
    * Pros: The filtered result tends to be more relevant.
    * Cons: User must enter the keyword correctly and completely to locate the desired appointments (partial words would not be matched).


* **Alternative 2:** Finds appointment by partial/complete keyword or date and time
    * Pros: More friendly to use when user cannot remember the full search term to use.
    * Cons: 
      * Filtering by date and time does not add much value since `sort -a` command already exists.
      * User might get less relevant filtered result.

## <a id="effort"></a>Effort

* **Difficulty level:** This project enhanced the current [AB3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) implementation to make it a more complicated application that includes more data entities including `Insurance`, `Record`, and `Appointment`. By taking into account our targeted user group's requirements, attributes of the entities were carefully selected so that they work together to provide beneficial functionalities for insurance agents.
* **Challenge faced:** 
  * The GUI needed to be rearranged to fit our data display needs, problems including responsiveness of the GUI and the appropriate types of JAVAFX components to be used were our top concerns.
  * To reduce coupling of different entities, we had to change/add internal structures and mechanisms such as parser to meet our needs.
* **Achievements:** Most of the added functionalities have strong cohesion and low coupling, making them extensible for future modifications.
* **Regarding reuse:** Added entities follow a similar structure as that used by `Person` in AB3, with modifications, which saved our efforts in maintaining consistency with the original AB3 as well as in creating the whole application structure.
