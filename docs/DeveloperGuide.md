## **Introduction**

ReCLIne is a desktop app which serves as a centralised location for recruiters to store and track job applicants and jobs,
optimized for use via a `Command Line Interface (CLI)` while still having the benefits of a `Graphical User Interface (GUI)`.

This Developer Guide assumes that its readers have some basic understanding of programming.

The purpose of this Develop Guide is to aid any curious or interested contributor in developing ReCLIne further by providing
an in-depth explanation of how the features are implemented.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of ReCLIne.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java).
It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteapplicant 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ApplicantListPanel`,
`JobListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml`
files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Applicant` or `Job` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddApplicant`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an applicant).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteapplicant 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteapplicant 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteApplicantParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZApplicantParser` or `XYZJobParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddApplicantParser` or `AddJobParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZApplicant` object (e.g., `AddApplicant`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZApplicantParser` and `XYZJobParser` classes (e.g., `AddApplicantParser`, `DeleteApplicantParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" /> <br>

This is a `slightly zoomed in version` of the Model Diagram for `Applicant`

<img src="images/CloseUpApplicant.png" width="450" />

This is a `slightly zoomed in version` of the Model Diagram for `Job`

<img src="images/CloseUpJob.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* Stores the address book data i.e., all `Applicant` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueApplicantList` object) and all `Job` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueJobList` object).
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Applicant` or `Job` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Applicant>` or `ObservableList<Job>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Applicant` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Applicant` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* saves both ReCLIne data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).

The `JsonAdaptedApplicant` and `JsonAdaptedJob` classes are used to convert the Job and Applicant models to and from their JSON format.
`idCount` is an integer that represents the job id to be assigned. When a new Job is added, it will be assigned the current `idCount` as its
job Id. `idCount` will then be incremented, and saved.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Ensure that the `idCount` is not smaller than any of the current Job ids in the Job list. This is because Job Id has to be unique, and since `idCount` is always incremented, it will result in duplicate ids in the application. <br>
</div>

The `JsonSerializableAddressBook` converts the current ReCLIne into a JSON file using the 2 classes, `JsonAdaptedApplicant` and `JsonAdaptedJob`. The idCount integer
in ReCLIne is stored directly without the use of any wrapper class.

The diagram below shows the structure of the JSON file. Applicants are stored in an array in the "applicants" property, while Jobs are stored in an array in "jobs".

<img src="images/Storage.png" width="450" />

To ensure that the data file is readable by the application, the user must ensure that the data file follows the JSON format shown
below. Take note of the JSON properties, they are **case-sensitive**, and ensure that the JSON object properties match the ones shown **exactly**.

__Sample ReCLIne.json__
```
{
 "applicants" : [ {
    "name" : "Alice Tan",
    "phone" : "98567843",
    "email" : "alicetan@example.com",
    "address" : "123, Jurong West Ave 6, #08-111",
    "tagged" : [ "Applicant" ],
    "nric" : "S9920202A",
    "job" : "2",
    "qualification" : "Degree in Sociology",
    "dateApplied" : "2022-02-12",
    "interviewDate" : "2022-03-18",
    "applicationStatus" : "1"
  }] ,
  "jobs" : [ {
    "jobTitle" : "Data Analyst",
    "companyName" : "Facebook",
    "id" : "1",
    "address" : "9 Straits View, Marina One",
    "qualification" : "Degree in Data Science",
    "jobStatus" : "filled",
    "position" : "ft",
    "salary" : "6000-8000"
  }] ,
  "idCount" : 11
}
```

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### AddApplicant feature
The `addapplicant` mechanism is facilitated by `AddApplicantParser` and `AddApplicant` command. It extends `AddressBook` with the capability to
create new applicants, and store them in the `UniqueApplicantList` of the `AddressBook`. Following the command pattern of the
application, the `parse()` method will parse the user input, use the arguments parsed to create a new `Applicant`, and then
the `Applicant` will be used to create an `AddApplicant` command.
The command will then be executed to add the new `Applicant` to the `AddressBook`.

Given below is an example usage scenario, and how the `addapplicant` mechanism behaves at each step. The scenario assumes that
the application is already launched.

Step 1. The user inputs the command `addapplicant n/John Tan nric/S1374678D p/98765432 e/johntan@hotmail.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 d/21-3-2022`.
The `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` is called in `LogicManager` and it uses the `BASIC_COMMAND_FORMAT` to separate the `commandWord` and `arguments`.
The `commandWord` will then cause a new `AddApplicantParser` to be created.

![AddApplicantStep1](images/AddApplicantStep1.png)

Step 2. The `AddApplicantParser#parse()` method is then called with `arguments` as the argument. The `arguments` will then be
further parsed using their respective class parser methods in `ParserUtil` to create their respective attribute classes,
and then used to create a new `Applicant` object. The `Applicant` object will be used to create a new `AddApplicant` command.

![AddApplicantStep2](images/AddApplicantStep2.png)

Step 3. The `AddApplicant` command is executed, and it will call the `Model#addApplicant()`, which calls the 
`AddressBook#addApplicant()`, to store the `Applicant` in the `UniqueApplicantList`. 

![AddApplicantStep3](images/AddApplicantStep3.png)

The following sequence diagram shows the full sequence when a user adds a new Applicant
![AddApplicantFullSequence](images/AddApplicantFullSequence.png)

### EditApplicant feature

The `editapplicant` mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. `EditApplicant` extends `Command` class. Within the `EditApplicant` class,
it has a nested class `EditApplicantDescriptor` that is used to store the updated Applicant details that will then be used
to create a new Applicant object. This new Applicant object will replace the current Applicant object that is in the `AddressBook`.

When the user wants to edit an applicant, the user will input `editapplicant` along with the index number of Applicant
and prefix of any attributes that the user wants to change followed by the new value of the attribute. The user only
needs to include the prefixes of attributes that he wants to change for a particular Applicant.

For example, `editapplicant 1 n/Alice Yeoh` will change the name of Applicant 1 to "Alice Yeoh".

Given below is an example usage scenario, and how the `editapplicant` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs `editapplicant 1 n/Alice Yeoh` into ReCLIne. `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` and `EditApplicantParser#parse()`
is executed, which will return a `EditApplicant` object.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `index` inputted is greater than the
size of the current `UniqueApplicantList` the execution of the command will fail. A `CommandException` will be thrown
and displayed for the user. This ensures that inputted `index` is not out of bound.

</div>

Step 2. `EditApplcant#execute()` is executed. Firstly, get the current Applicant object that is in the
indicated index in the `UniqueApplicantList`. In this case, Applicant 1 in the `UniqueApplicantList` is stored in the
`applicantToEdit` variable.

![EditApplicantState1](images/EditApplicantState1.png)

Step 3. Next, a new Applicant object, `editedApplicant`, that is going to replace `applicantToEdit` is created. This is done with
`createEditedApplicant`. Updated information will replace the current Applicant attributes in `applicantToEdit`. All other
attributes will be obtained from the current Applicant object.

![EditApplicantState2](images/EditApplicantState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** A check between the new Applicant object
and current Applicant object occurs. If both Applicant objects are the same, a `CommandException` is thrown. This ensures
that there is no duplicate Applicants in the `UniqueApplicantList` and `AddressBook`

</div>

Step 4. Lastly, the new Applicant object will replace the current Applicant object of the indicated index number in the
`AddressBook`.

![EditApplicantState3](images/EditApplicantState3.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `editapplicant` command works:

![EditApplicantSequenceDiagram](images/EditApplicantSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `editapplicant` command:

![EditApplicantActivityDiagram](images/EditApplicantActivityDiagram.png)


### MarkApplicant feature

The `markapplicant` mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. `MarkApplicant` extends `Command` class.
`MarkApplicant` updates the status via creating a new applicant object with  the new status value
and same original Applicant details.  This new Applicant object will replace the current Applicant object that is in the `AddressBook`.

When the user wants to mark an applicant, the user will input `markapplicant` along with the index number of Applicant,
and the new status value, which includes `pending`, `rejected`, `interviewed`,and `accepted`.

For example, the applicant has the default state of `pending` when it is initialized.
A command `markapplicant 1 s/rejected` will change the status of applicant in index 1 to rejected.

Given below is an example usage scenario, and how the `markapplicant` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs `markapplicant 1 s/rejected` into ReCLIne. `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`
and `MarkApplicantParser#parse()`. `MarkApplicantParser#parse()`calls `ParserUtil#parseIndex()` and `ParserUtil#parseApplicant()`,
which returns Index and ApplicantStatus objects representing the index and status value that user inputted. This returns a
`MarkApplicant` with Index and ApplicantStatus objects as arguments.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `index` inputted is greater than the
size of the current `UniqueApplicantList` the execution of the command will fail. A `CommandException` will be thrown
and displayed for the user. This ensures that inputted `index` is not out of bound.
</div>


Step 2. `MarkApplicant#execute()` is executed. Firstly, get the current Applicant object that is in the
indicated index in the `UniqueApplicantList`. In this case, Applicant 1 in the `UniqueApplicantList` is stored in the
`applicantToMark` variable.

![MarkApplicantState1](images/MarkApplicantState1.png)

Step 3. Next, a new Applicant object, `markedApplicant`, that is going to replace `applicantToMark` is created.
This is done by creating a new instance of `Applicant` with ApplicantStauts object containing the status
inputted by the user, in this case `rejected`.

![MarkApplicantState2](images/MarkApplicantState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** A check between the new Applicant object
and current Applicant object occurs. If both Applicant objects are the same, a `CommandException` is thrown. This ensures
that there is no duplicate Applicants in the `UniqueApplicantList` and `AddressBook`
</div>

Step 4. Lastly, `markedApplicant`t will replace the current A`applicantToMark` of the indicated index number in the
`AddressBook`.

![MarkApplicantState3](images/MarkApplicantState3.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `markapplicant` command works:

![MarkApplicantSequenceDiagram](images/MarkApplicantSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `markapplicant` command:

![MarkApplicantActivityDiagram](images/MarkApplicantActivityDiagram.png)

### DeleteApplicant feature

The `deleteapplicant` mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. `DeleteApplicant` extends `Command` class.

When the user wants to delete an applicant from the address book, the user will input `deleteapplicant` along with the
index number of the applicant. Note that this index is the same as the index that is displayed to the user under the
applicant list tab in the ReCLIne application.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `deleteapplicant` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs `deleteapplicant 1` into ReCLIne. `LogicManager#execute()` is executed, inside this method,
`LogicManager#execute()` is executed which will return a DeleteApplicant object.

Step 2. Inside `LogicManager#execute()`, `DeleteApplicant#execute()` is executed. Inside this method, we obtained the last
shown applicant list by calling `Model#getFilteredApplicantList()`. We also check if the index is invalid in `DeleteApplicant#execute()`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `index` inputted is invalid, meaning
that it is greater than the size of the current `UnqiueApplicantList` or it is a negative integer or 0, the execution of
the command will fail and `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` will throw a `CommandException` and the
`MESSAGE_INVALID_APPLICANT_DISPLAYED_INDEX` will be displayed to the user. This ensures that the inputted `index` is not out of bound.

</div>

Step 3. Next, we obtain the zero base of the target index by calling `Index#getZeroBased()`. This is because the index displayed in the applicant
list tab in the application list is in one based eg 1,2,3,4... We obtained the zero based of the target index so that we are able to get the
true index of the applicant in the last shown applicant list. We then obtain the applicant to delete from the last shown list via the zero based index

Step 4. Lastly, We then call `Model#deleteApplicant()` which will delete the targeted applicant from the applicant list.
The applicant will display the new applicant list without the deleted applicant and a MESSAGE_DELETE_APPLICANT_SUCCESS is shown.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `deleteapplicant` command works:

![DeleteApplicantSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteApplicantSequenceDiagram.png)

### AddJob feature
The design implementation for AddJob is similar to that for AddApplicant, but with classes to add a Job instead of Applicant. Refer to the section [above](DeveloperGuide.md#addapplicant-feature) on AddApplicant for the design considerations.

### EditJob feature
The design implementation for EditJob is similar to that for EditApplicant, but with classes to add a Job instead of Applicant. Refer to the section [above](DeveloperGuide.md#editapplicant-feature) on EditApplicant for the design considerations.

### MarkJob feature
The design implementation for MarkJob is similar to that for MarkApplicant, but with classes to add a Job instead of Applicant. Refer to the section [above](DeveloperGuide.md#markapplicant-feature) on MarkApplicant for the design considerations.

### DeleteJob feature
The design implementation for DeleteJob is similar to that for DeleteApplicant, but with classes to add a Job instead of Applicant. Refer to the section [above](DeveloperGuide.md#deleteapplicant-feature) on DeleteApplicant for the design considerations.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files
   1. Missing data file
      1. When ReCLIne cannot find a data file, it will automatically generate a sample data file containing sample data.
    This happens by default when a user installs a new ReCLIne for the first time. A user can look out for this log
         message when he starts the application to confirm. 
`"INFO: Data file not found. Will be starting with a sample ReCLIne"`
         
   2. Corrupted data file
      1. If the data file has been corrupted, or is unable to be read by ReCLIne for any reason, the application will
    start with an empty list for both applicants and jobs. A user can look out for this log message when he starts
         the application to confirm. `"WARNING: Data file not in the correct format. Will be starting with an empty ReCLIne"`
         
   3. Solutions
      1. To restart the application with a sampledata book, users will need to delete the data folder generated in the same folder
    as their ReCLIne.jar file.
      2. If the user is familiar with the JSON format, and wants to fix the corrupted file, he can attempt to do so by opening
    the `ReCLIne.json` file in the data folder, and try fixing the format error. Refer to the [storage section](DeveloperGuide.md#storage-component) of this Developer Guide
         to see the storage file format.
