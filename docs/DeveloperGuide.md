## **Introduction**

**What is LinkedOUT?**

LinkedOUT is the only application that any experienced recruiter needs. LinkedOUT allows recruiters to keep track of many applicants, and the job they applied for. You can store their contact details, skills and the round of their application, all in one place.

LinkedOUT helps recruiters manage the multiple job applications they may receive on a daily basis. With many applications, it may be difficult to keep track of each applicant and which application round they are currently at.

Thus, LinkedOUT aims to improve a recruiter's experience. LinkedOUT presents recruiters with the ability to flag important applicants, edit applicants easily and search for them with ease.

LinkedOUT comes with a Command Line Interface *CLI* as well as a Graphical User Interface *GUI* in order to provide recruiters a more streamlined experience.

**Who is this Developer Guide for?**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/linkedout/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/linkedout/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding *API* `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its *API* in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/linkedout/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ApplicantListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible *GUI*.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/linkedout/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Applicant` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/linkedout/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `LinkedoutParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an applicant).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` *API* call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
This limitation extends to the rest of our diagrams which are of the same type.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `LinkedoutParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `LinkedoutParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/linkedout/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the LinkedOUT application data i.e., all `Applicant` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueApplicantList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Applicant` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Applicant>`. This _filtered_ list is then wrapped around a `SortedList` to create a _filtered_, _sorted_ list that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes or is sorted.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/linkedout/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both LinkedOUT application data and user preference data in *JSON* format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `LinkedoutStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which mans it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.linkedout.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add applicant feature

**Rationale**

The add command allows the user to add a new applicant to the LinkedOUT list.

**Implementation**

The add command is facilitated by creating an `AddCommand`. `AddCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute()` method.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow for the add operation:

![AddCommandActivityDiagram](images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** There should only be one arrowhead at the end of every line
in the Activity Diagram. This is a known limitation of PlantUML. This limitation extends to the rest of our diagrams which are of the same type.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is an example usage scenario of how an applicant is added, and how the operation is handled by LinkedOUT:

1. The user enters a valid add command, for example: `add n/Bob p/99991111 e/bob@mail.com j/Data Analyst r/Interview s/Python`. For each command
`LogicManager#execute()` is invoked, which calls `LinkedoutParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `add` and the argument
`n/Bob p/99991111 e/bob@mail.com j/Data Analyst r/Interview s/Python`


2. Upon identifying the add command, `AddCommandParser` is instantiated and uses `AddCommandParser#parse()` to
map the various prefixes to the attributes: (e.g `n/` to `Bob`, `p/` to `99991111`)


3. `AddCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent()` is called to ensure all the mandatory prefixes have been inputted by the user. After which
`AddCommandParser#parse()` creates the new `Applicant`


4. `AddCommandParser#parse()` then initializes an `AddCommand` with the new `Applicant` as an argument. `AddCommand#execute()`
is then called, which calls `Model#hasApplicant()` to ensure that the new `Applicant` is not a duplicate of any existing applicant in the
LinkedOUT. upon completion of the check, `Model#addApplicant()` to add the new applicant in LinkedOUT.


5. The command is complete and a `CommandResult` containing the details of the new applicant as a String is returned to
the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

**Design considerations**

**Aspect: How add executes:**

* **Alternative 1 :** Check whether specified applicant already exists before creating an Applicant object.
    * Pros: Avoid creation of unnecessary objects
    * Cons: May cause reduced performance

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add Skill feature

**Rationale**

The addskill command allows users to add skills to a specific applicant. This command was designed to accommodate edit's functionality when editing skills. To remove skills from an applicant, one can choose to use edit instead.

The reasoning for only including an addskill functionality is that most applicants would pick up new skills, but not lose knowledge of pre-existing ones.

**Implementation**

The addskill mechanism is facililated by `AddSkillCommandParser`. 
`AddSkillCommandParser` parses the inputs using `AddSkillCommandParser#parseSkillsForEdit()` and returns a new set of skills to `AddSkillCommand`.

`AddSkillCommand` then searches for the applicant within the applicant list, and appends the skills to the pre-existing set.

As the skills being passed are checked in `AddSkillCommandParser` and `Skill` upon instantiation, skills parsed can contain a mix of symbols and alphanumeric. They must also be made up of 1 to 5 words.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram shows the workflow for the addskill operation:

![AddSkillActivityDiagram](images/AddSkillCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario of how an applicant is edited.

1. The user enters the addskill command with the specific index and skills to add, `addskill 1 s/C++ s/Vue`.


2. `LinkedoutParser` is invoked to handle the command `addskill` through `LinkedoutParser#parseCommand()`.


3. It then calls upon `AddSkillCommandParser#parse()` to check if the input is empty.


4. If input is not empty, it passes the input to `AddSkillCommandParser#parseSkillsForEdit()` to create a new set, representing the skills to be added.


5. The result is then used to instantiate `AddSkillCommand`. `AddSkillCommand` then finds the applicant at the specified index.


6. With `AddSkillCommand#createEditedApplicant()`, the applicant's pre-existing skills are appended with the new set, and the applicant is added to the model.


7. It then calls upon `CommandResult` to display the final result on the *GUI*.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the addskill operation works:

![AddSkillSequenceDiagram](images/AddSkillCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

**Design considerations**

**Aspect: How addskill executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new applicant replace old information.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Change edit command functionality to allow it to add, delete, clear and replace skills.
    * Pros: One lesser command needed.
    * Cons: Adds extra complexity in code as well as for the user.

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit applicant feature

**Rationale**

The edit command allows users to change the applicant's details.

**Implementation**

The proposed edit mechanism is facilitated by `EditApplicantDescriptor`. `EditApplicantDescriptor` stores the details of the applicant to change.

The user need to specify an `Index` to select the applicant to edit. `editCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute()` method.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow for the edit operation:

![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario of how an applicant is edited.

1. The user enters the edit command with the specific fields to edit, `edit 1 n/Alex Tan`. 

2. `LinkedoutParser` is invoked to handle the command `edit` through `LinkedoutParser#parseCommand()`.

4. It then calls upon `EditCommandParser#parse()` to map the various prefixes to the attributes: (e.g `n/` to `Alex Tan`).

5. If input is not empty, it passes the input to `EditCommandParser#parse()` to create a `EditApplicantDescriptor`,
   representing the applicant's attributes after editing. `EditApplicantDescriptor` also checks to make sure there are changes made.
   
6. The result is then used to instantiate `EditCommand`. `EditCommand` then finds the applicant at the specified index.

7. With `EditCommand#createEditedApplicant()`, the edited applicant is created with the new information and the applicant is added to the model.

8. It then calls upon `CommandResult` to display the final result on the *GUI*.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Design considerations**

**Aspect: How edit executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new applicant replace old information.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Replace individual fields inside original applicant.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (Do not have to create an extra applicant).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command to change an information is correct.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### View applicant feature

**Rationale**

The view command searches a **single** applicant in LinkedOUT and returns the applicant's details.
It is used when users wish to find a specific applicant they have in mind.
It takes in a single case-insensitive parameter, which is the applicant's full name. No prefix is required.

**Implementation**

The view command is facilitated by `NameContainsAllKeywordsPredicate` which helps the parser match the input.

The user needs to specify a `Name` to allow the application to match and select the applicant. `ViewCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute()` method.

As `ViewCommandParser` uses `NameContainsAllKeywordsPredicate`, the `Name` being passed will not match if it contains additional whitespace, but will match inputs which are case-insensitive.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow for the view operation:

![ViewActivityDiagram](images/ViewActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario of how to view a specific applicant.

1. The user enters the view command with the specific name, `view Alex Tan`.


2. `LinkedoutParser` is invoked to handle the command `view` through `LinkedoutParser#parseCommand()`.


3. It then calls upon `ViewCommandParser#parse()` to check if the input is empty.


4. If input is not empty, it passes the input to `NameContainsAllKeywordsPredicate()`.


5. The result is then initialized as a predicate in `ViewCommand`. `ViewCommand#execute()` then tries to find a match.


6. It then calls upon `CommandResult` to display the final result on the *GUI*.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view operation works:

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

**Design considerations**

**Aspect: How view executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Shows a single applicant.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Result is specific.
    * Cons: Strict matching.
    * Cons: Have to remember applicant's name and type it fully.

* **Alternative 2:** Shows multiple applicants based on partial matches.
    * Pros: Less strict matching.
    * Cons: Users are unable to single out a certain applicant.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Weighing the pros and cons of these alternatives, we have decided to abstract alternative 2 as a different feature under `search`.
This is to allow our target user to have greater flexibility, and we believe both are important features to be implemented.

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Search applicant feature

**Rationale**

The search command searches for applicant(s) in LinkedOUT and returns the applicant(s)' details.
It is used when users wish to search for applicant(s) they have in mind.
It takes in prefix(es) with case-insensitive parameter, which can be applicant's name, job, round and skill.

**Implementation**

The proposed search mechanism is facilitated by `SearchCommandParser`. `SearchCommandParser` will map the creation of `KeywordsPredicate` based on the input prefix. `KeywordsPredicate` supports the following implementation:
* `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` — Predicate which returns true if an applicant's full name matches partially with the exact input attribute.
* `JobContainsKeywordsPredicate` — Predicate which returns true if an applicant's job name matches partially with the exact input attribute.
* `RoundContainsKeywordsPredicate` — Predicate which returns true if an applicant's round matches partially with the exact input attribute.
* `ApplicantContainsSkillKeywordsPredicate` — Predicate which returns true if an applicant's skill matches partially with the exact input attribute.

These predicates assist the filtering of applicant list in the `Model` interface, specifically for  `Model#updateSearchApplicantList()` and `Model#getDefaultApplicantList()`.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow of the search command:

![SearchActivityDiagram](images/SearchCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

Example 1
1. The user enters search command with prefix and specified attribute, `search n/David Lee`.


2. The input attributes will be passed into `SearchCommandParser` and creates a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` if the attribute
   and prefix are not empty.


3. The predicate is then passed into `Model#updateSearchApplicantList()` to filter and display applicants with partial name
   matching of `David` or `Lee` in LinkedOUT.


Example 2
1. The user enters `search j/Software n/David` command to search for applicants in LinkedOUT.


2. The input attributes will be passed into `SearchCommandParser` and creates a `JobContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` if the attributes are not empty.


3. The predicate is then passed into `Model#updateSearchApplicantList()` to filter and sort the applicants with partial job and name matching of `Software` or `David`. Applicant with the most matched attributes will be displayed on the top of LinkedOUT.

The following sequence diagram shows how the search operation works:

![SearchSequenceDiagram](images/SearchSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Design considerations**:

**Aspect: How search executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses prefixes to search for applicants with combination of matching attributes.
    * Pros: Able to search an applicant using combination of different fields/prefixes. Provides a more precise and broader search.
    * Cons: Hard to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Only search for an applicant using partial matching name.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Inflexible use of search command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Sort applicant feature

**Rationale**

The sort command shows the list of applicants **temporarily** sorted by either `NAME` or `JOB` and in ascending or descending order.

**Implementation**

The proposed sort mechanism is facilitated by `SortCommandParser`. 
`SortCommandParser` will map the creation of `SortComparator` based on the input prefix and returns a `SortCommand` with
the `SortComparator`.

`SortCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute()` method.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow of the search command:

![SortActivityDiagram](images/SortCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user enters the sort command with the specific field to sort by and sorting order,
   `sort f/name o/asc`.
   
2. The input fields will be passed into `SortCommandParser` and creates a `SortComparator` 
   if the field and order are not empty.
   
3. The `SortComparator` is then passed into `Model#updateDefaultApplicantList()` to sort and display
   the list of sorted applicants in LinkedOUT.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

**Design considerations**:

**Aspect: How sort executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displays a temporary sorted list
    * Pros: Original order of list retained.
    * Cons: Unable to sort list permanently.

* **Alternative 2:** Sort list permanently.
    * Pros: List can be permanently sorted.
    * Cons: Original order in list is lost.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Flag applicant feature

**Rationale**

The flag feature and it's associated `flag` command allows the user to flag an existing applicant in the LinkedOUT list, pinning them to the top for easy reference.

**Implementation**
The flag mechanism is facilitated by the `FlagCommandParser`. `FlagCommandParser` parses the user inputs using `FlagCommandParser#parse()` to obtain the index of the applicant to be flagged.

`FlagCommand` then searches for the applicant in the applicant list, and toggles it's flagged status.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow for the flag operation:

![FlagCommandActivityDiagram](images/FlagCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario of how an applicant is flagged, and how the operation is handled by LinkedOUT:

1. The user enters a valid flag command, for example: `flag 1`. For each command `LogicManager#execute()` is invoked, which calls `LinkedoutParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `flag` and the argument `1`.

2. Upon identifying the flag command, `FlagCommandParser` is instantiated and uses `FlagCommandParser#parse()` to obtain the index of the applicant to be flagged.

3. `ParserUtil#parseIndex(args)` is then called by `FlagCommandParser#parse()` to obtain the index of the applicant to be flagged as an argument to be passed around internal components, as well as to check the validity of the index provided.   

4. `FlagCommandParser#parse()` then initializes a `FlagCommand` with the obtained index as the argument.
   
5. The logic manager calls `FlagCommand#execute()` which obtains the applicant at the specified index.
    
6. With `FlagCommand#createFlaggedApplicant()`, the applicant obtained is cloned, but it's flagged status is toggled, and the initial applicant obtained is replaced by its cloned version.

7. A call to `CommandResult` then displays the final result on the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the flag operation works:

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Design considerations**

**Aspect: How flag executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new applicant with toggled flag status to replace the specified applicant.
  * Pros: Immutability, easier to debug, and less side effects.
  * Cons: More memory usage, more verbose to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Change the state of the applicant directly, by making the flag status mutable.
  * Pros: Less verbose to implement.
  * Cons: Change of applicant state makes debugging the application harder, and contains possibility of introducing side effects.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Technical: The application should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Performance: The application should be able to hold up to 1000 applicants without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  Performance: The system should take at most 2 seconds to return an output.
4.  Disaster Recovery: In case of system failure, the application should still contain data saved up to the last command executed.
5.  Persistency: The system should save after executing commands that modify the list to ensure no data loss.
6.  Testing: There should be at least one test case for each major component.
7.  Fault Tolerance: The system should not crash due to an invalid input but instead show an error message.
8.  Portability: The application should run on an imported _JSON_ file as long as it adheres to the format used when saving to files.
9.  Efficiency: A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
10. Usability: The user interface should be clean and intuitive for users who have basic IT knowledge.
11. Process: The project is expected to adhere to a schedule based off our milestones from the different versions ranging from v1.1 to v1.4.
12. Documentation: User Guide should be able to be understood by readers who have basic IT knowledge.

### Adding an applicant

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Code blocks for the *Adding an applicant* section:**
The commands in code blocks for this section are meant to be inputted in one line.
</div>

1. Adding an applicant while all applicants are being shown in the *GUI*.

    1. Prerequisites: List all applicants using the `list` command. Multiple applicants in the list. No other applicant named Alice in the list.
       Bob is an applicant in the list.

    2. Test case: 
       ```
       add 
       n/Alice 
       p/99990000 
       e/alice@mail.com 
       j/Software Engineer
       r/Technical Interview
       s/Java
       ```
       Expected: An applicant named Alice with the above attributes will be added to the applicant list and displayed on the *GUI*.

    3. Test case:
       ```
       add
       n/Bob
       p/99990000
       e/bob@mail.com
       j/Site Reliability Engineer
       r/Technical Interview
       s/Jira 
       s/SonarQube
       ```
       Expected: No changes occur as an applicant named Bob is already in the list, and duplicate applicants with the same names are not allowed.

    4. Test case:
       ```
       add 
       n/Charles 
       s/Haskell
       ```
       Expected: No changes occur as the phone number, email, job applied to and round of interview are all mandatory attributes
       that are not included in the above add command. These must be specified with the `p/`, `e/`, `j/` and `r/` prefixes respectively.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add skills to an applicant

1. Adding a skill to an applicant while all applicants are being shown in the *GUI*.

    1. Prerequisites: List all applicants using the `list` command. Multiple applicants in the list.
       Current State: The first applicant has pre-existing skills of `JavaScript` and `TypeScript`.

    1. Test case: `addskill 1 s/Python s/Java`<br>
       Expected: New skills `Python` and `Java` are added to the first applicant's skill list.

    1. Test case: `addskill 1 s/JavaScript`<br>
       Expected: No new skill will be added to first applicant's skill list as it already exists. No error is thrown.

    1. Test case: `addskill 1 s/Javascript`<br>
       Expected: New skill `Javascript` will be added to first applicant's skill list. This is because the skills are case-insensitive,
       hence `Javascript` and `JavaScript` will be treated as two different skills.

    1. Test case: `addskill 0 s/Python s/Java`<br>

### Editing an applicant

1. Editing an applicant while all applicants are being shown in the *GUI*.

    1. Prerequisites: List all applicants using the `list` command. Multiple applicants in the list.
       Current State: The first applicant is Bob, with the following attributes:
       ```         
       Name: Bob
       Phone Number: 99991111
       Email Address: bob@mail.com

       Round: Interview 
       Skills: Python
       ```

    2. Test case: `edit 1 n/Charles e/charles@mail.com` <br>
       Expected: The first applicant's name is changed to `Charles` and the email address is changed
       to `charles@mail.com`. All other attributes remain unchanged.

    3. Test case: `edit 1 s/Javascript s/Java` <br>
       Expected: The first applicant's existing skills are removed, and only `Javascript` and `Java`
       will be in their skill list. All other attributes remain unchanged.

    4. Test case: `edit 1 s/` <br>
       Expected: All skills are removed from the first applicant, their skill list will now be empty.
       All other attributes remain unchanged.

    5. Test case: `edit 0 n/Jamie` <br>
       Expected: No changes occur, as 0 is an invalid index. Error details shown in status message

    6. Other incorrect edit commands to try: `edit o/Jamie`, `edit p/Jamie`, `edit x n/Jamie`

    2. Test case: `view Bob Tan`<br>
       Expected: Only applicant named `Bob Tan` is displayed in the list.

    3. Test case: `view Tan`<br>
       Expected: No applicant is displayed in the list.

    4. Test case: `view n/Bob Tan`<br>
       Expected: No applicant is displayed in the list. This is because prefix is not needed in view.

    5. Test case: `view BobTan`<br>
       Expected: No applicant is displayed in the list. This is because exact full name with correct spacing is needed to view on an applicant.

    6. Test case: `view bob tan`<br>
       Expected: Only applicant named `Bob Tan` is displayed in the list. This is because full name are case-insensitive.

    7. Other incorrect view commands to try: `view` and `View`<br>

## **Appendix: Effort**

If we assume that the effort required to create AddressBook3 is 100, our team believes that the effort required to make
LinkedOUT is 130.

Our group has put in much commendable effort in order to refactor and modify the model of AB3 in order to satisfy the requirements
of LinkedOUT.

The amount of effort that we have put in is evidenced by our code contributions which number around 10k lines of code (LoC).

### Notable Features
* Add
* Edit  
* Add Skill
* View
* Search
* Sort
* Flag
* Clear

The effort made in these areas can be evidenced from reading the rest of the Developer Guide, particularly the features' implementation details.

### Notable Achievements
* Updated GUI
  * AB3 had a very simple user interface, and consisted just mainly of plain text, without much formatting or regard to UI/UX design.
  * In LinkedOUT, key fields such as skills and application round are highlighted in light colours that contrast the dark background, helping users take stock of key information.
  * LinkedOUT also makes use of icons which are more relatable and easier on the eyes. For instance, the flag status is repreented by a flag icon.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* Great abstraction
  * AB3 already had large amounts of abstraction, and our group adhered to this by abstracting large amounts of code. For instance, in sort and search operations, ordering applicants is handled by a SortedList
    which sorts its elements with a specified comparator. 
  * Another example of this is how the group wrote a new parser for each command, instead of reusing current ones, to ensure that SOLID principles are adhered to.
    

* Used Test Driven Development
  * Whenever our group implemented a new feature or a new field, we followed the procedure of test-driven development where we wrote
    unit tests to test these features alongside writing the code, to ensure that the number of bugs can be reduced.
  * Additionally, after the PED, the group spent a large amount of time fixing AB3 bugs, to ensure that the application is as bug-free as possible.  

    
* Ease-of-use
  * This ties in with abstraction, where the group made commands as simple to execute as possible, so that fast typists can complete tasks easily and effectively.
  * Most commands in LinkedOUT are not lengthy, and require a minimal amount of typing to perform potentially complex tasks such as sorting and searching by multiple prefixes. 
    This is because the group put in much effort to hide these details from the user, choosing to handle such issues in implementation instead.
