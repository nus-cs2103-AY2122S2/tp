## **Introduction**

### **Purpose**

This document specifies architecture and software design decisions for the application, CamNUS.
CamNUS (Continuous Assessment Manager NUS) is an application for Teaching Assistants to manage their classes and keep
track of the graded components of a module such as class participation, assignments and exams.

### **Scope**

This describes the software architecture and software design decisions for the implementation
of CamNUS. The intended audience of this document is the developers, designers, and
software testers of CamNUS.

### **Design Goals**

#### **Maintainability**

With a team of developers working on a project, it is important that developers are able to change one
component of the project without needing to change many components that other developers
may be working on.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `DisplayListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays a list of `Displayable` objects residing in the `Model`.
* objects belonging to a class that implement the `Displayable` interface can be shown in the UI component
* Classes that implement `Displayable` are:
  1. `Person`
  2. `Student`
  3. `Tutorial`
  4. `Comment`
  5. `Attendance`
  6. `Assessment`
  7. `StudentResult`

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object), all `Assessment` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueAssessmentList`) and all `Tutorial` objects (which are stored in a `UniqueTutorialList`).
* stores the `Displayable` objects currently shown on the UI (e.g. results of user commands) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Displayable>` that can be 'observed' (the Logic component uses this list to ensure that users enter index-related commands that are suitable for the objects being displayed).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Tutorial` objects (e.g., results of a list command) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `FilteredList<Tutorial>` that can be 'observed'.
* stores all `Assessment` objects in a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `FilteredList<Assessment>` that can be 'observed'.
* stores 'selected' `Attendance`, `StudentResult` and `Comment` objects in separate _filtered_ lists to be used by the Logic component for related commands.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Detailed Help Window feature
#### Implementation

This `HelpWindow` extends `AddressBook` with a detailed Help Window implementing the following operations:
* `HelpWindow#addIntroText()` —  Shows the user the introduction text of the application describing its purpose.
* `HelpWindow#addDevGuideText()` —  Shows the user a clickable hyperlink for the Developer Guide
* `HelpWindow#showCommands()` —  Shows the user a list of the commands present in camNUS, along with a detailed guide for each command.

These operations are exposed in the `HelpWindow` class as `HelpWindow#addIntroText()`, `HelpWindow#addDevGuideText()` and `HelpWindow#showCommands()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Help Window behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. A `HelpWindow` is created and initialized with the default `HelpWindow#addIntroText()` to show the user the introduction text. However, this `HelpWindow` is not shown until the user requests for it.

Step 2. The user executes `help` command to show the help window. The `help` command calls `MainWindow#handleHelp()`, causing the application to show the help window.

![HelpWindowState1](images/HelpWindowState0.png)

Step 3. The user clicks on the button `Commands` in the help window. This calls `HelpWindow#showCommands()`, causing the display pane containing the introduction text to be deleted, and a new display pane containing the list of command details to be added to the `HelpWindow`.

![HelpWindowState2](images/HelpWindowState1.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how this operation works:

![HelpWindowSequence0](images/HelpWindowSequence0.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `introPane:AnchorPane` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Step 4. After browsing through the list of commands, the user decides now that he/she wants to view the full Developer Guide for more explicit information. The user clicks on the button `Developer Guide` in the help window. This calls `HelpWindow#addDevGuideText()`, causing the display pane containing the command list to be deleted, and a new display pane containing the Developer Guide hyperlink to be added to the `HelpWindow`.

![HelpWindowState3](images/HelpWindowState2.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How each button executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes current display pane, creates new display pane.
    * Pros: Easy to implement. Low on memory usage.
    * Cons: If more graphic elements are added to enhance this feature, it may have performance issues in terms of performance usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Create persistent display panes for all 3 features: Introduction Text, Command List, and Developer Guide link. Show or hide them when required.
    * Pros: Faster performance, since no new objects are created after initialization.
    * Cons: Harder to implement, have to ensure that the display panes are correctly positioned and hidden/shown when required.

### Display Students Feature

#### Implementation

The display students feature is facilitated by the enhanced `MainWindow` of the `UI` component. It extends the application with a `DisplayListPanel` that could display a list of `Student` and `Tutorial`, other than `Person`, by implementing the following operations:

* `MainWindow#handlePerson()` — Shows the list of persons stored in the application.
* `MainWindow#handleClass()` — Shows the list of classes stored in the application.
* `MainWindow#handleStudent()` — Shows the list of students stored in the application.

These operations are exposed in the `MainWindow` class as `MainWindow#handlePerson()`, `MainWindow#handleClass()` and `MainWindow#handleStudent()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `MainWindow` will be initialized with the initial `DisplayListPanel` displaying the list of persons stored in the application.

![ListStudentCommandState0](images/ListStudentCommandState0.png)

Step 2. The user inputs `list_class` command to see the list of classes. The `list_class` command calls `MainWindow#handleClass()`, causing the `DisplayListPanel` to be replaced with a new `DisplayListPanel` that displays the list of classes stored in the application.

![ListStudentCommandState0](images/ListStudentCommandState1.png)

Step 3. The user inputs `list_student 1` command to see the list of students in the first class of the previously displayed list. The `list_student` command calls `MainWindow#handleStudent()`, causing the `DisplayListPanel` to be replaced with a new `DisplayListPanel` that displays the list of students stored in the application that belong to the specified class .

![ListStudentCommandState0](images/ListStudentCommandState2.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

![ListStudentSequenceDiagram](images/ListStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the panel displaying each list executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Replaces the current panel with a new panel in displaying a different type of list
    * Pros:
      * Easy to implement
      * Low on memory usage
      * Can accommodate a large variety in type of list as long as the contents implement the `Displayable` interface
    * Cons:
      * Requires more changes to the existing code, with the implementation of an interface and an enumeration
      * Additionally, the existing `Person` class will also need to be modified to implement the interface

* **Alternative 2:** Create multiple panels to display different lists
    * Pros:
      * Requires less modifications to existing code.
      * Shows every list available at a glance.
      * Does not require the user to key in commands to switch between lists.
    * Cons:
      * Difficulty in accommodating a larger variety of different lists with the implementation of more features in future
      * The UI can appear messy in the presence of multiple long lists

### Add Assessment Feature
#### Implementation
The `add_assessment` command is facilitated by the enhanced `AddressBook`. It extends the `model` package with an `Assessment` class and its field classes, `AssessmentName`, `Weightage` and `FullMark`. It also extends the `AddressBook` with the `assessments` field, which is a `UniqueAssessmentList`. It implements the following operations:
- `AddressBook#hasAssessment()` —  Checks if an assessment is present inside `assessments`.
- `AddressBook#addAssessment()` —  Adds an assessment to `assessments` if it is not already in the list.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#hasAssessment()` and `Model#addAssessment()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how `add_assessment` behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with an empty `UniqueAssessmentList`. The `MainWindow` will be initialized with the initial `DisplayListPanel` displaying the list of persons stored in the application.

![AddAssessmentCommandState0](images/AddAssessmentCommandState0.png)

Step 2. The user inputs `add_assessment as/Test 1 w/10 w/10` to add an assessment to camNUS. The `assessments` list in the `AddressBook` will have an additional assessment. The updated list of assessments is displayed to the user in the `DisplayListPanel` in the `MainWindow`.

![AddAssessmentCommandState1](images/AddAssessmentCommandState1.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the add assessment operation works:


![AddAssessmentSequenceDiagram](images/AddAssessmentSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: How assessments and student results are stored in the model:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** assessments are stored as `Assessment` objects in the `AddressBook`'s `assessments` list. The student results for each assessment is stored inside an `AssessmentResults` object which is stored inside an `AssessmentResultsList` in each `Tutorial`.
    * Pros:
        * Can quickly display the list of results of a tutorial in an assessment, which is a useful feature for TAs.
        * High degree of abstraction may allow future changes in the implementation of assessment results and student result.
        * Does not require many changes to the existing code as the `AddressBook` class is simply updated with new fields to store the assessment and tutorial list.
    * Cons:
        * Code is not easy to understand.
        * Retrieving an individual student's result for an assessment may take slightly more time (as it requires searching the list of assessment results for the requested assessment and then searching the list of student results for the requested student). However, this is not a big concern as usually the number of assessments and the size of classes are not large in real life.

* **Alternative 2:** Each `Student` stores their own results. The `Tutorial` does not contain student results.
    * Pros:
        * Less hierarchical design - easier to understand code.
        * Can quickly display the results for all assessments of a student. However, this feature is deemed less important than displaying the results of all students in a class for a particular assessment, which helps TAs gauge the relative performance and needs of students.
    * Cons:
        * Displaying the list of results of a tutorial requires accessing each student and searching in their assessment results list. This may require more complex code and slow down performance as compared to Alternative 1.

### Add Student Feature

This `AddStudentCommand` feature is facilitated by display student feature. It extends the application implementing the
following operations:

* `AddStudentCommand#execute()` — Find corresponding `Person` and set it to a `Student`.

The operation is facilitated by the `Model` interface using `Model#addStudent()`,`Model#hasPersonWithName()`
, `Model#getPersonWithName()`, `Model#hasTutorialWithName()` and `Model#hasStudentWithName()`.

Given below is an example scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `add n/B ...` to add a new`Person`. The new `PersonCard` with the corresponding populated details will be displayed on the
`DisplayListPanel` displaying the list of `Person` stored in the application.

![AddStudentCommandState0](images/AddStudentCommandState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `add_student n/C ...` command to add a student. The add_student command
call `Model#getPersonWithName()` is used to retrieve the corresponding `Person`.

![AddStudentCommandState1](images/AddStudentCommandState1.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:**Note:** The add_student command call
`Model#hasPersonWithName()` and `Model#hasTutorialWithName()` to check if corresponding `Person` and `Tutorial` exists.
The command calls `Model#hasStudentWithName` to ensure there is no already exist student with the same details.
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#getPersonWithName()`.

</div>

Step 3. The command creates a `Student` using the Person C's details, then uses `Model#add_student()` to replace the
original `Person` with a `Student`.

![AddStudentCommandState2](images/AddStudentCommandState2.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how this operation works:

![AddStudentSequenceDiagram](images/AddStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the person is handled in add_student:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Replace the original person with the student.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: More checks needed to determine if handling a person or a student.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a separate student list and leave person untouched.
    * Pros: Fewer checks on whether person is a student required.
    * Cons: Additional filters required to remove duplicates when displaying both persons and students.

### Remove Student Feature

This `RemoveStudentCommand`feature is facilitated by the display students feature. It extends the application by
implementing the following operations:

* `RemoveStudentCommand#execute()` - Find corresponding `Student` and set it to a `Person`.

The operation is facilitated by the `Model` interface using `Model#hasTutorialWithName()`,
`Model#tutorialHasStudentWithId()`, `Model#getStudentWithId()`, `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`,
`Model#removeStudent()`.

Given below are two example scenarios based on different command inputs and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

##### Scenario 1: `remove_student id/...`
Step 1. The user executes `remove_student id/...` command to remove a student. The `remove_student` command calls
`Model#getStudentWithId()` to retrieve the corresponding Student.

![BeforeRemoveStudent](images/RemoveStudentCommandState1a.png)


Step 2. The student is removed with `Model#removeStudent()` which extracts the fields of the Student object that are
relevant to create a new Person object, to replace the Student object.

![BeforeRemoveStudent](images/RemoveStudentCommandState1b.png)

##### Scenario 2: `remove_student INDEX...`

Step 1. The user executes `list_student` command and the `DisplayListPanel` displays a list of all Students in the
application.

refer to [Display Students Feature](#display-students-feature) to see how the `list_student` command works.

Step 2. The user executes `remove_student INDEX...` command, where `INDEX` is the index of the desired student to be removed
in the current `DisplayListPanel`.

Step 3. The student to be removed is extracted from the list and removed using `Model#removeStudent()`.

**Note:** In both scenarios, validity checks are done with `Model#hasTutorialWithName()`,
`Model#tutorialHasStudentWithId()` and for scenario 2, additional checks are done to ensure index entered is not out of
bounds and that the desired index is referring to a Student object.

The following sequence diagram shows how this operation works:

![RemoveStudentSequenceDiagram](images/RemoveStudentCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

##### Scenario 1: How the student is retrieved from the application
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** model requests for Student object iteratively from the components in the Model component (i.e. calls AddressBook which calls UniqueTutorialList and so on )
  * Pros: Law of Demeter is followed and coupling between classes is decreased.
  * Cons: More code required.
* **Alternative 2:** model access request for the Tutorial object and retrieves Student object directly from Tutorial.
  * Pros: Easier to implement because fewer methods are needed to go through each component.
  * Cons: Increased coupling between classes.

##### Scenario 2: How the student is retrieved from the application
* **Current choice:** Direct access from `filteredPersonList()`
  * Pros: Easiest way to access a Student from a filtered list using index.
  * Cons: Increases coupling within classes. Currently, have no other solution to decrease coupling.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
