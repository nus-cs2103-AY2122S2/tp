### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="500" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="250" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Event` objects residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Event` objects (whihc are contained in a `UniqueEventList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The alternative (arguably, a more OOP) models are given below for `Person` and `Event` separately. The `Person` model has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/TagClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
<img src="images/EventClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
</div>


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Delete multiple persons enhancement

#### Original Implementation
Originally, the idea was to simply call `deletePerson` on each integer, but this will not work as the indexes of each person
in the contact list might change depending on the order of deletion. <br>

**For example:** <br>
In a list with only 3 contacts, `delete 1 2 3` will not be allowed as there is no longer an index 3 during the 3rd deletion.

#### Current Implementation

The delete command now has to accept multiple indexes as a valid input. The ParserUtil class can easily facilitate this
behaviour by extending the validity checks on the entire string of input.

The workaround is then to delete each person from the largest to the smallest index. The success message displays the details
of those deleted, so in order to show them in the same order as the input, all the details are first extracted out before deletion.<br>

**For example:** <br>
Similarly, in a list with only 3 contacts, `delete 1 2 3` will now be allowed.

**Step 1.** User enters `delete 1 2 3` and `LogicManager` would execute it.

**Step 2.** `LogicManager` would pass the arguments to `AddressBookParser` to parse the command as a `DeleteCommand`.

**Step 3.** The arguments `1 2 3` would be passed into `DeleteCommandParser` to detect if the deletion is for multiple persons using `ParserUtil`.

**Step 4.** Information about Person 1, Person 2 and Person 3 will be extracted according to the last shown list.<br>

**Step 5.** The deletion process starts sequentially. Person 3 gets deleted followed by Person 2, then Person 1. This ensures correctness in the deletion process.


The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic component for the `execute("delete 1 2 3")` API call.

<img src="images/DeleteMultipleSequenceDiagram0.png" />
<img src="images/DeleteMultipleSequenceDiagram1.png" width="400"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Tag feature

#### Current Implementation
The current tagging feature is originally a functionality in the `Add` command. However, it was extracted out and made
into its own command in order to help facilitate a clearer distinction between those features. The `Tag` command would
allow users to tag additional information to existing persons in the address book.

With this new introduction of the Tag Command, it led to the creation of the abstract class `Tag`. The idea was to only
allow subclasses of `Tag` to be tagged to a person. Currently, there are 4 of such subclasses that extends from `Tag`:
* `Cca` - stores information about the person's cca
* `Education` - stores information about the person's degree course
* `Module` - stores information about the person's module
* `Internship` - stores information about the person's internship

![Class diagram for Tag](images/TagClassDiagram.png)

Below is an example usage scenario and how the tagging mechanism behaves at each step:

**Step 1.** The user enters the following valid `TagCommand`: `tag 1 edu/computer science m/cs2030s m/cs2040s` and `LogicManager`
would execute it.

**Step 2.** `LogicManger` would pass the argument to `AddressBookParser` to parse the command and identify it as a `TagCommand`.
It will then pass the arguments to `TagCommandParser` to handle the parsing for the identified `TagCommand`.

**Step 3.** `TagCommandParser` would first parse the index using `ParserUtil#parseIndex()` to identify the person to tag to.
Afterwards, `TagCommandParser` would parse the tag arguments provided using `ParserUtil#parseTags()` to identify the individual
tag types for the arguments provided.

**Step 4.** After parsing the arguments, the control is handed over to `TagCommand` where it will return a `TagCommand` object. It
will eventually return to `LogicManager` which will call `TagCommand#execute()` to execute the command.

**Step 5.** Upon execution, the person will be fetched and tagged using `Model#setPerson`. The edited person would then be updated
and stored in the addressbook. `CommandResult` would then generate a success message to inform the user the person has been tagged
successfully.

The following sequence diagram shows how the tag operation works:
<img src="images/TagSequenceDiagram0.png" />
<img src="images/TagSequenceDiagram1.png" width="400"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Remove Tag feature

#### Current implementation
The `removetag` command creates and copies the target `Person` into a new `Person` object, except all tags are stored in hashsets instead. <br>
Hashsets allow the application to perform fast searches and checks, such as checking if all provided tags are existing tags in the target `Person` and to utilize the `removeAll()` function.
`removetag` will not allow user to remove a non-existent tag.

Given below is an example scenario of how the `removetag` command works.

**Step 1:** User inputs the following valid `removetag` command: `removetag 2 m/cs2107 m/cs2100`.

**Step 2:** The second person on the contact list happens to be David, and he has 4 tags. Below is an object diagram of David during the command execution, before any removal of tags.

<img src="images/RemoveTagState0.png" width="450" />

**Step 3:** After checking that David indeed has the module tags `cs2107` and `cs2100` given by the command input, the command will execute the removal of tags.

**Step 4:** The removal of tags is successful, and a success message will be generated.

<img src="images/RemoveTagState1.png" width="450" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagrams shows how the `removetag` operation works: <br>

<img src="images/RemoveTagSequenceDiagram0.png" />
<img src="images/RemoveTagSequenceDiagram1.png" width="500"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Event feature

#### Current Implementation
The event command allows the user to create an event which will be stored in the address book. Each `Event` has the following
fields:
* `EventName` - the name of the event
* `Information`- additional details about the event
* `Participants` - the persons participating in this event
* `DateTime` - the date and time of the event

For each `Event`, the user is able to indicate which of the following persons will be tagged to the event being created. Hence,
`Delete` and `Edit` have dependencies on `Event` where changes in the participants' names would have to be changed and reflected
accordingly for the respective events that are affected.

Below is an example usage scenario and how the event mechanism behaves at each step:

**Step 1.** The user enters the valid `EventCommand` : `event 1 name/Lunch Appt info/Having lunch at Hai Di Lao d/2023-02-20 t/12:15` and
`LogicManager` would execute it.

**Step 2.** `LogicManger` would pass the argument to `AddressBookParser` to parse the command and identify it as an `EventCommand`.
It will then pass the arguments to `EventCommandParser` to handle the parsing for the identified `EventCommand`.

**Step 3.** `EventCommandParser` would first parse the index using `ParserUtil#parseIndex()` to identify the person to tag to the event.
Afterwards, `EventCommandParser` would parse the event arguments provided using `ParserUtil#parseEventName()` to identify the event name,
`ParserUtil#parseInfo()` to identify the event details and `ParserUtil#parseDateTime()` to identify the event date and time.

**Step 4.** After parsing the arguments, the control is handed over to `EventCommand` where it will return an `EventCommand` object. It
will eventually return to `LogicManager` which will call `EventCommand#execute()` to execute the command.

**Step 5.** Upon execution, the event will be created and added into the `AddressBook` using `Model#addEvent`.
`CommandResult` would then generate a success message to inform the user the event has been added successfully.

The following sequence diagram shows how the tag operation works:
<img src="images/EventSequenceDiagram0.png" />
<img src="images/EventSequenceDiagram1.png" width="500"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Cancel Event feature

#### Current Implementation
The cancel event command would allow the user to cancel and remove an event from the address book. The index specified by the user would
lead to the deletion of the corresponding event in the event list, as long as it is a valid index. The user also has the option of specifying
multiple indexes if multiple deletions are required.

Below is an example usage scenario and how the tagging mechanism behaves at each step:

**Step 1.** The user enters the valid `CancelEventCommand` : `cancelevent 1 2` and `LogicManager` would execute it.

**Step 2.** `LogicManger` would pass the argument to `AddressBookParser` to parse the command and identify it as an `CancelEventCommand`.
It will then pass the arguments to `CancelEventCommandParser` to handle the parsing for the identified `CancelEventCommand`.

**Step 3.** `CancelEventCommandParser` would first parse the string of indexes using `ParserUtil#parseIndexes()` to identify the events
and ensure the indexes are unique and positive integers.

**Step 4.** After parsing the arguments, the control is handed over to `CancelEventCommand` where it will return a `CancelEventCommand` object. It
will eventually return to `LogicManager` which will call `CancelEventCommand#execute()` to execute the command.

**Step 5.** Upon execution, the information of the events will be extracted using `CancelEventCommand#extractDeletedInfo()` that will be use as output for the
notifying the user later. Afterwards, the events will be deleted from the `AddressBook` using `Model#deleteEvent` within `CancelEventCommand#deleteFromList`.
Finally, `CommandResult` would then generate a success message to inform the user the event has been added successfully.

The following sequence diagram shows how the tag operation works:
![Cancel Event Sequence Diagram](images/CancelEventSequenceDiagram0.png)
![Cancel Event Sequence Diagram](images/CancelEventSequenceDiagram1.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit Feature

#### Original Implementation
The `edit` command uses an `EditPersonDescriptor` to store the new information that is to be changed in the person. The
`EditCommandParser` parses the information input and then creates an `EditPersonDescriptor` where the unchanged fields
are copied over from the existing person and the fields to be overwritten are changed. The Find command then takes in
the descriptor and simply changes the persons attribute values to the values stated in the descriptor.

#### Current Implementation
We initially built the `edit` command to allow overwriting of the tag lists. However later we removed that functionality so the command
can only be used to edit the main fields. This is because we realised that it is easier to use the `tag` and `removetag` commands to
edit the tag lists instead.

Below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step:

**Step 1.** The user enters a valid `EditCommand` : `edit 1 n/Alex Ho p/87497763` and `LogicManager` would execute it.

**Step 2.** `LogicManager` would pass the argument to `AddressBookParser` to parse the command and identify it as a `EditCommand`.
It will then pass the arguments to the `EditCommandParser` to handle the parsing for the identified `EditCommand`.

**Step 3.** `EditCommandParser` would first parse the index using `ParserUtil#parseIndex()` to identify the person to edit.
Afterwards, it would separately parse the arguments according to prefixes using `ArgumentTokenizer#Tokerize()`.
In this case it would use the parsing functions `ParserUtil#parseName()` and `ParserUtil#parsePhone()` to parse the name and phone number into
`Name` and `Phone` objects.

**Step 4.** These parsed fields are then stored in a `EditPersonDescriptor` object, which is then passed into `FindCommand`.
Control is handed over to `FindCommand` which will eventually return to `LogicManager`, which will call `FindCommand#Execute()` to
execute the command.

**Step 5.** Upon execution, the person will be fetched and edited using `Model#setPerson`. The edited person would then be updated
and stored in the addressbook. `CommandResult` would then generate a success message to inform the user the person has been edited
successfully.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:
![EditCommand Sequence Diagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram0.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find feature

#### Original Implementation
The existing Find feature in AB3 only allowed contacts to be searched for by name. We added additional functionalities
to allow for greater flexibility when filtering large contacts lists according to specific predicates. The `Find` and
`Find -s` command now allow the user to search for specific contact details (name, phone number, email and address) or
specific tags.

#### Current Implementation
The `Find` command searches for contacts that satisfy any of the given predicates while the `Find -s` command searches
for contacts that satisfy all the given predicates. Do note that the conjunction and disjunction also applies within
each tag field (see User Guide for more details).

Below is an example scenario of how the finding mechanism behaves at each step:
**Step 1.** The user enters the valid `FindCommand` : `find n/Alex Yeoh edu/computer science` and `LogicManager` would execute it.

**Step 2.** `LogicManger` would pass the argument to `AddressBookParser` to parse the command and identify it as an `FindCommand`.
It will then pass the arguments to `FindCommandParser` to handle the parsing for the identified `FindCommand`.

**Step 3.** `FindCommandParser` would separately parse the arguments according to prefixes. So in this case, it would parse the name
as 'Alex Yeoh' and the education tag as 'computer science'. These would be identified as the fields being searched for. The parsing functions
are in ParserUtil (in this case, `ParserUtil#parseNames()` and `ParserUtil#parseTagsForFind()`)

**Step 4.** After parsing the arguments, a FindOrPredicateParser object containing these arguments (in the form of a `FindPersonDescriptor` object)
is created. FindOrPredicateParser converts the fields searched for into classes that extends `Predicate<Person>` (such as
`NameConatainsKeywordPredicateOr` for the name field). It then does the logical 'OR' operation on all the predicates

**Step 5.** Control is then handed over to FindCommand which takes the predicate as a constructor argument. `FindCommand#execute()`
then calls `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList()` with the predicate as the argument. This changes the filteredList that is
rendered by the UI to only show the contacts for which the predicate evaluates to True. Finally, a CommandResult object with a success
message is returned.

The following class diagram shows important classes for the `find` command and their relationships. Note that there are similar classes
for `find -s` and `find -e`

![Find Class Diagram](images/FindClassDiagram.png)

The find command uses several `Predicate` classes in its implementation of the feature. The partial class diagram below describes
the relationship between these classes. The predicates for Email and Address follow the same pattern as the ones for Name and Phone.
The predicates for Internship and Education follow the same pattern as those for Cca and Module. They were left out to simplify the diagram.

![Class diagram for FindPredicates](images/FindPredicatesClassDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

**Step 2.** The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

**Step 3.** The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

**Step 4.** The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

**Step 5.** The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

**Step 6.** The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The system should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.
5. The system should respond within 3 seconds.
6. The product is strictly an offline application and data is stored locally.
7. The product is not required to handle the feature of finding past events based on the date and time.
(i.e using a past date & time for the "find -e" command would be invalid)
8. The product is not required to handle multiple whitespaces in between words for all data field inputs.
(i.e "Alison Baker" will not be identified the same as "AlisonÂ Â Â Â Becker")
9. The product is not required to handle the multiple events occurring at the same time.
(i.e Multiple events sharing the same date and time would be recognized as separate unique events respectively)
10. The product is not required to handle the visibility of long addresses in the person's contact card.
11. The system should be usable by a novice who has used CLI commands before.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

    1. To simulate a missing or corrupted file, navigate to the `data` folder and delete `addressbook.json` or modify some data to be invalid (such as changing an event's date to 31st February or making someone's phone number exceed 10 digits).
    1. Open the application, you will be greeted with an empty addressbook.
    1. To recover, simply edit the `addressbook.json` again and reverse the changes made.
    1. **Caution:** Deleting the whole `addressbook.json` fixes the issue as well. However, all previous data will be lost, and a sample addressbook will be loaded.

2. How to save

    1. NUSocials saves to any changes right away, there is no need for a manual save.
