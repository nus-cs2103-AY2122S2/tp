## **Introduction**

**LinkyTime** is a cross-platform desktop application designed for NUS Computer Science students to efficiently keep track of their online meetings and classes. The application is optimized for use via the Command Line Interface (CLI).

This Developer Guide (DG) serves to aid developers in explaining the design, architecture, and implementation of LinkyTime and its features. It also covers design considerations for specific features, and a guide on how to perform manual testing.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes clean-up methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MeetingListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays the `Meeting` and `Module` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `LinkyTimeParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddMeetingCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a meeting).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `LinkyTimeParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddMeetingCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddMeetingCommand`) which the `LinkyTimeParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddMeetingCommandParser`, `DeleteModuleCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800" />

The `Model` component,

* stores LinkyTime data i.e., all `Meeting` and `Module` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueMeetingList` and a `UniqueModuleList` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Meeting` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable list `ObservableList<Meeting>` and `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components, i.e. `Storage`, `Model`, `UI` (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both LinkyTime data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `LinkyTimeStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Meetings
The Meetings component consists of the following set of features: List Meeting, Add Meeting, Edit Meeting, Delete Meeting, Find Meeting, and Opening Meeting URL.

#### The Meeting class
The Meeting class is made up of a `MeetingName`, `MeetingUrl`, `MeetingDateTime`, `Module`, `MeetingDuration`, `IsRecurring`,
`Set<Tag>`, and a set of getter methods that corresponds to these fields.

##### Recurring Meetings
A meeting is recurring if it's set to repeat on a weekly basis. Such meetings would never expire.

This section describes how the start and end date time of a recurring meeting is computed. The key implementation lies in
`getNextRecurrence`, a helper method which computes the next recurrence relative to the current date and time. Since
`getStartDateTime` and `getEndDateTime` utilises `getNextRecurrence`, they inherit the side effect of depending
on the current date and time as well.

Below is an activity diagram describing the execution of `getNextRecurrence`.

![`getNextRecurrence` activity diagram](images/GetNextRecurrenceActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How the notion of recurrence is implemented:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `getStartDateTime` and `getEndDateTime` will return their respective date times
relative to the current date time.
* Pros: Easier to implement and integrate with other components such as GUI and storage.
* Cons: Unit-testing is less trivial since `getStartDateTime` and `getEndDateTime` would return different date times
depending on when their test cases are executed.

**Alternative 2:** Generate the next set of recurring meetings to replace the existing ones. This is done at the start
of the program and after each command execution.
* Cons: Implementation would sprawl across different components and more effort is required to ensure correctness.

### Commands
This section explains the general implementation of all commands.
The implementation of all commands in LinkyTime can be split into two general implementation flows: commands with a command-specific parser, and commands without.

#### Commands with a parser
This section explains the general implementation of all commands that require a command-specific parser to handle additional user input.

Below is the sequence diagram for the execution of these commands (denoted by `XYZCommand`) after user input is sent to `LogicManager`. The execution of each command has been omitted due to their differences and will be covered in the respective command sections.

![`CommandsWithParser` sequence diagram](images/CommandsWithParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1:
The user enters a command with additional required parameters (requires a command-specific parser) which is then passed to the `LogicManager`.

Step 2:
The `LogicManager` then calls `LinkyTimeParser::parseCommand` for it to figure out what command this is.

Step 3:
The `LinkyTimeParser` parses the user input and creates a command parser for that specific command. (denoted by `XYZCommandParser`)

Step 4:
The command parser is then returned to the `LinkyTimeParser` which then calls `XYZCommandParser::parse` to parse the additional parameters.

Step 5:
The `XYZCommandParser` then creates its respective command (denoted by `XYZCommand`) and returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 6:
The `LogicManager` then calls `XYZCommand::execute` where the interaction between the command and the model is handled.

Step 7:
The `XYZCommand` then creates a successful `CommandResult` and returns it to the UI.

#### Commands without a parser
This section explains the general implementation of all commands that does not require a command-specific parser.

Below is the sequence diagram for the execution of these commands (denoted by `XYZCommand`) after user input is sent to `LogicManager`. The execution of each command has been omitted due to their differences and will be covered in the respective command sections.

![`CommandsWithoutParser` sequence diagram](images/CommandsWithoutParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1:
The user enters a command which is then passed to the `LogicManager`.

Step 2:
The `LogicManager` then calls `LinkyTimeParser::parseCommand` for it to figure out what command this is.

Step 3:
The `LinkyTimeParser` parses the user input and creates the respective command object (denoted by `XYZCommand`).

Step 4:
The `XYZCommand` is then returned to the `LogicManager`.

Step 5:
The `LogicManager` then calls `XYZCommand::execute` where the interaction between the command and the model is handled.

Step 6:
The `XYZCommand` then creates a successful `CommandResult` and returns it to the UI.

#### List Meetings feature
This section explains the implementation of the List Meetings feature via the `list` command.
The `ListMeetingCommand` updates the UI to display the details of all upcoming meetings in `LinkyTime`.
This command [does not require a parser](#commands-without-a-parser). 

Below is the sequence diagram reference frame for the execution of `ListMeetingCommand`.

![`ListMeetingCommand` sequence diagram](images/ListMeetingSequenceDiagramReferenceFrame.png)

Step 1:
The `LogicManager` calls `ListMeetingCommand::execute` with the returned `ListMeetingCommand`.

Step 2:
The `ListMeetingCommand` then calls `Model::showCompletedMeetings` to update the meeting list to show only upcoming meetings.

Step 3:
The `ListMeetingCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#commands-without-a-parser) sequence diagram.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ListMeetingCommand` should continue out of this reference frame, but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline ends in this diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How `ListMeetingCommand` executes:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `LinkyTimeParser` returns a `ListMeetingCommand` without having a parser.
* Pros: Easier to implement and allows for more flexible user input.
* Cons: All user inputs that contains `list` as its first word will result in the execution of `ListMeetingCommand`,
  including those that don't make sense. E.g. `list abc`

**Alternative 2:** `LinkyTimeParser` uses a `ListMeetingCommandParser` to enforce that the user input cannot have additional params.
* Pros: Provides clear definition of what the user input for a `ListMeetingCommand` should be.
* Cons: Harder to implement and more rigid in nature.

#### Archive Meetings feature
This section explains the implementation of the Archive Meetings feature via the `archive` command.
The `ArchiveMeetingCommand` updates the UI to display the details of all completed meetings in `LinkyTime`.
It is identical in implementation to the `ListMeetingCommand` except for the flip in the boolean that is passed into `Model::showCompletedMeetings`.

#### Add Meeting feature

This section explains the implementation of the Add Meeting feature via the `add` command.
The `AddMeetingCommand` causes the specified meeting to be added to the application.
This command requires several compulsory fields such as the meeting name, URL, date time, duration, module, and whether it is recurring.
There is only one optional field which is the tags of the meeting.
This command [requires a parser](#commands-with-a-parser).

Below is the sequence diagram reference frame for the execution of `AddMeetingCommand`.

![`AddMeetingCommand` sequence diagram](images/AddMeetingSequenceDiagramReferenceFrame.png)

Step 1:
The `LogicManager` invokes `AddMeetingCommand::execute`, which in turn calls `Model::addMeeting` to add the
new meeting into the list.

Step 2:
The `Model` will then call its own `updateFilteredMeetingList` method in order to update the model's filter to display
all meetings.

Step 3:
The `AddMeetingCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#commands-with-a-parser) sequence diagram.

##### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How AddMeetingCommand executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Let the `LogicManager` pass the model to the command to execute.
    * Pros: Will not need to expose the model to the individual `AddMeetingCommand`.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the model in the `AddMeetingCommand` itself.
    * Pros: Easier to implement and trace.
    * Cons: The `AddMeetingCommand` might be able to abuse the model by calling the model's other methods.

#### Delete Meeting feature

This section explains the implementation of the Delete Meeting feature via the `delete` command.
The `DeleteMeetingCommand` removes the meeting with the given index from the meeting list. This command requires a
single field: the index of the meeting to be deleted. 
This command [requires a parser](#commands-with-a-parser).

Below is the sequence diagram reference frame for the execution of an `DeleteMeetingCommand`.

![`DeleteMeetingCommand` Sequence Diagram](images/DeleteMeetingSequenceDiagramReferenceFrame.png)

Step 1:
The `LogicManager` calls `DeleteMeetingCommand::execute` with the returned `DeleteMeetingCommand`.

Step 2:
The `DeleteMeetingCommand` then calls `Model::deleteMeeting` to remove the target meeting from the list.

Step 3:
The `DeleteMeetingCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#commands-with-a-parser) sequence diagram.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How `DeleteMeetingCommand` executes:**

* Similar to the considerations of the `AddMeetingCommand`, this command is also concerned with the model storage and
  the modification of the underlying model object.

#### Find Meeting feature

This section explains the implementation of the Find Meeting feature via the `find` command. The `FindMeetingCommand`
causes the GUI to only show meetings that matches the given keywords.
This command [requires a parser](#commands-with-a-parser).

Below is the sequence diagram reference frame for the execution of the `FindMeetingCommand`.

![`FindMeetingCommand` sequence diagram](images/FindMeetingSequenceDiagramReferenceFrame.png)

Step 1:
`LogicManager` calls `FindMeetingCommand::execute`.

Step 2:
`FindMeetingCommand` calls `Model::updateFilteredMeetingList` with a predicate that describes the criteria for the meetings to be shown.

Step 3:
The `FindMeetingCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#commands-with-a-parser) sequence diagram.

##### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How FindMeetingCommand executes:**

* Similar to the considerations of the `AddMeetingCommand`, this command is also concerned with the model storage and
  the modification of the underlying model object.

**Aspect : Behaviour of find command when multiple keywords are provided:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Command will return meetings which match **all** the given keywords.
    * Pros: Command can be used to narrow down a search to a small set of desired meetings.
    * Cons: Command may be too restrictive, requiring users to ensure that all keywords provided match the desired
      meetings.

* **Alternative 2:** Command will return meetings which match **at least one** of the given keywords.
    * Pros: Command can be used to find a diverse set of meetings that users may be interested in.
    * Cons: Command cannot be used to narrow down the search; adding more keywords may increase the number of meetings
      returned.

#### Open Meeting Feature

This section explains the implementation of the Open Meeting feature via the `open` command. The `OpenMeetingCommand` causes the application to open the given link in the desktop default browser. This is a command that [requires a parser](#commands-with-a-parser).

Below is the sequence diagram reference frame for the execution of `OpenMeetingCommand`.

![`OpenMeetingCommand` Sequence Diagram](images/OpenMeetingSequenceDiagramReferenceFrame.png)

Step 1:
`LogicManager` calls `OpenMeetingCommand::execute`.

Step 2:
`OpenMeetingCommand` creates a new `UrlOpenerManager` and calls `OpenMeetingCommand::executeWithUrlOpener` with it.

Step 3:
`OpenMeetingCommand` gets the `Url` from the `Model` and calls `UrlOpenerManager::open` with it.

Step 4:
The `OpenMeetingCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#commands-with-a-parser) sequence diagram.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Which component to handle desktop capabilities:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a `UrlOpener` interface and a `UrlOpenerManager` to handle communication with the desktop.
    * Pros: Ease of testing as the behaviour of the desktop can be mocked using stubs. 
    * Cons: Additional complexity and more areas for bugs.

* **Alternative 2:** Handle all communication with the desktop within `OpenCommand`.
    * Pros: Simpler implementation with less components to maintain.
    * Cons: Much harder to decouple the command logic from the behaviour of the desktop, which may differ according to the environment in which the tests are run. For example, when running tests meant for desktops on GitHub actions (a headless environment without desktop/browser capabilities), the tests for this command will fail.


### Modules

The Modules component consists of the following set of features: Add Module, Edit Module, Delete Module.

All module-related commands are prefixed with an `m` to distinguish it from meeting-related commands.

#### The Module class

The Module class consists of a single field, and input validation happens directly inside the class via `Module::isValidModule`.

The `Module` objects are stored in a `UniqueModuleList` which is held by `LinkyTime`.

##### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the module code string directly in the Module object.
  * Pros: Easy to implement and understand.
  * Cons: Difficult to add additional fields in the future.
* **Alternative 2:** Abstract the field out as a separate class.
  * Pros:
    * More object-oriented approach.
    * Responsibility of field verification would be done by the field class instead of the Module class.
  * Cons:
    * Over-abstraction of the Module class for the current implementation which consists of only one field.
    * May not be intuitive to understand at first glance.

As we do not intend to contain any additional fields within the Module object, we opted for a simpler approach in its design.

#### Delete Module feature

This section explains the implementation of the Delete Module feature via the `mdelete` command.

The `DeleteModuleCommand` causes the specified module to be deleted from the application.

If there are meetings that are tagged under this module, the command execution is blocked and an error message is displayed to the user.
This command can be forced, see [below](#force-delete-module-feature).

This process is summarized in the diagram below.

![`DeleteModuleCommand` activity diagram](images/DeleteModuleActivityDiagram.png)

#### Force Delete Module feature

This feature is an extension to the existing Delete Module feature. By supplying an additional force-delete flag (`f/`) to the `DeleteModuleCommand` parameters, this would override the delete restriction and remove the selected modules and its associated meetings.

This command [requires a parser](#commands-with-a-parser). The sequence diagram for the `DeleteModuleCommand` is as shown below.

## **Appendix: Effort**

If the effort required to create **AB3** is 100, we would place the effort that our group put into **LinkyTime** at 150.

Our group has put in a significant amount effort to morph the model of **AB3** to fit that of **LinkyTime**. On top of that,
we also implemented several new features that complements our product well. As testament to our effort, we have over 10000 lines
of code and over 300 automated test cases which covers over 73% of our code.

### Notable Changes

* **Updated GUI**
  * With respect to the GUI components provided by **AB3**, **LinkyTime** has more GUI components in order to support its additional features. Each of the GUI components added were properly thought out to be intuitive and provide good UX.
  * We altered the base UI of **AB3** that was working with `person` to work with `meeting` and its data instead. On top of that we added another GUI segment for `module`. Finally, we had to address the issues that was present in the base version of **AB3** such as the overflowing of characters.
  * To ensure that our GUI is intuitive and user-friendly, we had to trial and error for a proper default and minimum window size.

* **Unit Testing**
  * With respect to unit tests that were present in **AB3**, due to the changes in the model, many of the existing test cases did not work for **LinkyTime**. 
  * Due to the introduction of module and the unique requirement that meetings can't exist without a module many of the initial test cases for the different commands had to be tested much more in depth in order to ensure that it worked.
  * On top of that because almost all the fields of `Meeting` is different from `Person`, there was a need to recreate test cases for each of the fields in `Meeting`. 
  * The most notable of all the test cases were the ones that involved meeting recurrence. Due to the concept of ongoing/completed meetings, we needed to create test cases that worked relative to our current date and time.

* **Auto-sort meeting chronologically**
  * Rather than implementing a sort command for users to sort according to a sort function, we decided it would be much more intuitive for the user to have access to a constantly sorted list.
  * As such we implemented it such that the meeting list would be displayed chronologically regardless of what filter it current has. This was relatively hard to implement due to the limitations of JavaFX and how **AB3** worked with JavaFX. 

* **Opening of Meeting Links**
  * Accessing meeting links is a central use case of LinkyTime, and most conventional applications would achieve that by allowing their users to click on the links presented in the GUI.
  * However, since LinkyTime is a CLI application, we wanted to stay faithful to this mode of user interaction while enabling our users to swiftly and ergonomically open their meeting links.
  * As such, we implemented an `open` command to do just that, and fire up our userâ€™s meeting links in their default web browsers.
  * In addition, this feature does not leverage on any existing AB3 implementation.
  * Hence, we had to design our own URL opening abstraction from scratch with the aid of the Java AWT library.

* **List and Archive**
  * To ensure that our users are able to access meeting information that is relevant at the instance theyâ€™re using LinkyTime, our application defaults to showing meetings that are either ongoing or coming up.
  * This would mean that non-recurring meetings that have elapsed would be hidden, and possibly be inaccessible. 
  * To balance the need to show our users the most up-to-date information while not restricting any valid use they might have with the outdated ones, our `Model` enforces one of two invariants on our `filteredMeetingList`. 
  * This means that at any one time, our `filteredMeetingList` either contains meetings that have elapsed, or meetings that are ongoing or coming up. 
  * The toggling of this invariant is also exposed through our `Model` interface, which our `list` command leverages on to show all ongoing and upcoming meetings. 
  * Likewise, our `archive` command leverages on that as well to show all elapsed non-recurring meetings. 
  * In turn, this allows us to indicate to our users if theyâ€™re looking at elapsed or ongoing/upcoming meetings for a better user experience.
  
* **Adding Meeting and Module Models**
  * To start off our refactoring from AB3's address book to LinkyTime's meeting management, we first had to create the models for `Meeting` and `Module`.
  * We had to implement models for `MeetingUrl`, `MeetingDateTime`, `MeetingDuration`, etc., in the same package as `Meeting`.
  * The only reused model was `Tag` and we also adapted `MeetingName` from AB3's `Name`.
  * For `Module`, we only had to implement one model. However, we decided to implement it in a separate package to follow OOP design principles.
  * We also had to create unique lists to ensure that there are no duplicates for both `Meeting` and `Module`.
  * Finally, due to using `Meeting` and `Module`, we had to refactor the majority of the codebase in order to accommodate these changes.
