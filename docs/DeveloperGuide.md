### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` , `TaskListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Task` objects residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, task list data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `TaskListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Task Storage Feature (Yu An)

The proposed task storage feature is facilitated by `TaskListStorage` that follows original AB3's `AddressBookStorage` implementation closely.
Everytime when the user successfully executes a task command that either adds, deletes or updates a task, the data will be
written into `tasklist.json` and be saved to a `data` folder. The `tasklist.json` will also get updated when the user
executes `exit` command.

Below is an activity diagram to aid the understanding when data reading from and writing to the `tasklist.json` will happen:

![TaskListStorageActivityDiagram](images/TaskListStorageActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Proposed\] Add Task Feature (Yu An)
#### Proposed Implementation
The proposed add task feature is facilitated by `AddTaskCommand`. It extends `Command` and makes use of a new model `TaskList` and `Task`.
The `TaskList` model consists of an `ArrayList<Task>` to store the `Task`. The `AddTaskCommand` also has a `AddTaskCommandParser`
to do the logical parsing of the user's input. Additionally, this feature implements the following operations:

* `AddTaskCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes the command.
* `AddTaskCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Make sense of the user's input and returns an `AddTaskCommand` object.
* `TaskList#addTask()`â€‰â€”â€‰Add a new task to the task list if user's input is valid.

The `TaskList#addTask()` is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addTask()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add task feature works.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow of the add task operation:

The user will type in the command `addt d/DESCRIPTION [t/DEADLINE (dd/mm/yyyy)]` with the deadline being an optional field.
If a valid format is detected, the system will create a new task, add it to the task list and prompt the user that a
task has been successfully added.

![AddTaskCommandActivityDiagram](images/AddTaskCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the add task operation works assuming no exception is thrown:

![AddTaskCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AddTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Proposed\] Find Task Feature (Yu Meng)
#### Proposed Implementation
The proposed find task feature is facilitated by `FindTaskCommand`. It extends `Command` and makes use of the `TaskList` model
and `Task`. The `TaskList` Model is used to retrieve the `Tasks` that have been stored. The `FindTaskCommand` also has a
`FindTaskCommandParser` to do the logical parsing of the user's input. It uses regex to ignore case sensitivity of user's input.
These are the operations that the feature implements:
* `FindTaskCommand#execute()` : Executes the command.
* `FindTaskCommandParser#parse()` :  Parses the user input and returns a `FindTaskCommand` Object.
* `TaskList#findTask()` : Finds and returns tasks matching keyword from user input (ignores case sensitivity)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find task feature works.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow of add task operation:

The user will type in the command `findt KEYWORD`. If the user inputs a valid format, the system will retrieve matching
tasks from the TaskList. If there is one or more matching Tasks, the system will prompt the user with the matching Tasks.

![FindTaskCommandActivityDiagram](images/FindTaskActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the add task operation work assuming no exception is thrown:

![FindTaskCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Proposed\] Add Delete Task Feature (Ivor)
#### Proposed Implementation
The proposed delete task feature is facilitated by `DeleteTaskCommand`. It extends `Command` and makes use of a new model `TaskList` and `Task`.
The `TaskList` model consists of an `ArrayList<Task>` to store the `Task`. The `DeleteTaskCommand` also has a `DeleteTaskCommandParser`
to do the logical parsing of the user's input. Additionally, this feature implements the following operations:

* `DeleteTaskCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes the command.
* `DeleteTaskCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Make sense of the user's input and returns an `DeleteTaskCommand` object.
* `TaskList#deleteTask()`â€‰â€”â€‰Delete an existing task in the task list if user's input is valid.

The `TaskList#deleteTask()` is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteTask()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete task feature works.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow of the delete task operation:

The user will type in the command `delt <integer>`.
If a valid format is detected, the system will remove the corresponding task with the integer ID, and prompt the user that a
task has been successfully deleted.

![DeleteTaskCommandActivityDiagram](images/DeleteTaskActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete task operation works assuming no exception is thrown:

![DeleteTaskCommandSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Proposed\] Add Update Task Feature (Ivor)
#### Proposed Implementation
The proposed update task feature is facilitated by `UpdateTaskCommand`. It extends `Command` and make use of a new model `TaskList` and `Task`.
The `TaskList` model consists of an `ArrayList<Task>` to store the `Task`. The `UpdateTaskCommand` also has a `UpdateTaskCommandParser`
to do the logical parsing of user's input. Additionally, this feature implements the following operations:

* `UpdateTaskCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes the command.
* `UpdateTaskCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Make sense of the user's input and returns an `UpdateTaskCommand` object.
* `TaskList#updateTask()`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates an existing task in the task list if user's input is valid.

The `TaskList#updateTask()` is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateTask()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the update task feature works.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow of the delete task operation:

The user will type in the command `updt <integer> d\new description t\ new deadline`. Either parameter is optional but at least one must be provided.
If a valid format is detected, the system will update the corresponding task with the integer ID with the new attributes, and prompt the user that a
task has been successfully updated.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1a. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    1b. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

    1c. If double-click does not work, user can run `java -jar NUScheduler.jar` in terminal in the same directory as the jar file.

2. Saving window preferences

    2a. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    2b. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.


### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
