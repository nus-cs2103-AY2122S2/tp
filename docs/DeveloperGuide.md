### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.


### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts, namely `MeetingListPanel`, `PersonListPanel` and other UI parts that have been left out of the diagram. The other parts include `StatusBarFooter`, `ResultDisplay`, `CommandBox`, `HelpWindow` and `MeetingClashWindow`.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Contact` objects and `Meeting` objects residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletec 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletec 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteContactCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![Model Class Diagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Contact` objects and all `Meeting` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object and a `UniqueMeetingList` respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Contact` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Meeting` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Meeting>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has two `Tag` lists in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` and `Meeting` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` and each `Meeting` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br><br>

![Better](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="740" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
### Add Meeting feature

This section describes how a ```Meeting``` object is added to the list of meetings using the ```addm``` command.

#### Implementation

A ```Meeting``` object in AddresSoc consists of ```MeetingName```,```MeetingDate```,```StartTime```,```EndTime```,
as well as the optional ```Tags``` and ```Participants``` fields. Upon the ```addm``` command being called with the
relevant fields provided, a ```Meeting``` will be added to the ```UniqueMeetingList```.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the ```addm``` command behaves at each step.
1. The user inputs the command ```addm mn/2103 Meeting d/25/03/2022 st/1600 et/1800 t/Important pt/2 pt/3```
2. The user input is passed into ```AddressBookParser``` which matches the ```addm``` command word and passes the arguments to ```AddMeetingCommandParser```.
3. ```AddMeetingCommandParser``` parses the arguments according to the prefixes and constructs a ```AddMeetingCommand``` object.
4. The ```AddMeetingCommand``` object is returned to ```LogicManager``` to be executed. During execution, the ```Meeting``` object with the given fields is constructed and added to the ```UniqueMeetingList```.

#### Sequence Diagram

The sequence diagram below shows the execution of the above example:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `addm mn/2103 Meeting d/25/03/2022 st/1600 et/1800 t/Important pt/2 pt/3` Command](images/AddMeetingSequenceDiagram.png)

</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**The arguments for methods and constructors have been shortened for clarity in the diagram.
</div>

#### Activity Diagram

The activity diagram below shows the execution of the above example:

![Add Meeting activity diagram](images/AddMeetingActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The Create Participant â‹” references the Create Participant
Activity Diagram in the Managing meeting participants section below.
</div>

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How `Participant` is constructed**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Participant` constructed using a `Contact`.
    * Pros: Better extensibility as it will be possible to implement features that can interact with the `Participant` in each meeting.
    * Cons: More difficult to implement as a `Participant` would need to change if changes are made to the corresponding `Contact`.
* **Alternative 2:** `Participant` constructed using a `String`.
    * Pros: `Participant` has less dependence on `Contact`. Better flexibility as each `Participant` no longer needs to be a `Contact`.
    * Cons: Less extensibility as `Participant` does not have any link to `Contact`. Changes to each `Contact` that is in a `Meeting` will require a separate command to change the `Participant` as well.

**Aspect: How to deal with clash in `Meeting` timings**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A clash in timings will notify the user of the clash.
    * Pros: User is still allowed to add meetings regardless of the timing of other meetings in the list.
    * Cons: Clash in meetings are left in the meeting list until the user deals with it. May cause confusion for the user if not dealt with.
* **Alternative 2** A clash in timings will throw an exception.
    * Pros: Meetings that clash will not be added and will not cause confusion for the user. The user can edit or remove clashing meetings before attempting to add the meeting again.
    * Cons: Will require more steps to adding a meeting with time clash. User will have to edit or remove clashing meetings before adding again.

Reasons for choosing Alternative 1:

* Overall, it is more efficient for the user as the original meeting will be successfully added to the list. The implemented
  notification pop-up should suffice in prompting the user to resolve any clashes in timings through editing or removing
  them. This implementation provides the user with more freedom as to how they would want to deal with the clash or simply
  make a mental note of it and not deal with it in the application at all.


### Find Contact feature

#### Implementation

The contacts of AddresSoc are stored in a `FilteredList`. The `FilteredList` is updated using `FilteredList#setPredicate`.
The feature uses a combination of `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `ContactTagContainsKeywordsPredicate` as a predicate.
Upon the ```findc``` command being called with the relevant fields provided, the ```FilteredList``` object is updated in accordance with the predicate and then displayed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the ```findc``` command behaves at each step.
1. The user inputs the command ```findc n/alex t/friends```
2. The user input is passed into ```AddressBookParser``` which matches the ```findc``` command word and passes the arguments to ```FindContactCommandParser```.
3. ```FindContactCommandParser``` parses the arguments according to the prefixes and constructs a ```FindContactCommand``` object.
4. The ```FindContactCommand``` object is returned to ```LogicManager``` to be executed. During execution, the ```FilteredList<Contact>``` object is updated and displayed.

#### Sequence Diagram

The sequence diagram below shows the execution of the above example:

</div>

#### Activity Diagram

The activity diagram below shows the execution of the above example:

![Find Contact activity diagram](images/FindContactActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How `names` and `tags` matches:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only full names are matched
    * Pros: Filtered List will look less cluttered and allows users to easily look up a particular contact
    * Cons: Users have less flexibility to search the contacts

* **Alternative 2:** Names that contain the input phrase is matched
  itself.
    * Pros: Users have more flexibility to search the contacts
    * Cons: The filtered list will be bloated and makes it difficult to look up a particular contact.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It keeps track of AddressBook states, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#canUndo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks that `currentStatePointer` is not pointing to the first state in the `addressBookStateList`.
* `VersionedAddressBook#canRedo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks that `currentStatePointer` is not pointing to the last state in the `addressBookStateList`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`, `Model#redoAddressBook()`, `Model#canUndo` and `Model#canRedo` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Managing meeting participants

#### Implementation

A `Meeting` object in AddresSoc has a set containing 0 or more participants, each represented by a
`Participant` object. Each `Participant` holds a reference to a `Contact` that exists in the
`UniquePersonList` of the `AddressBook`. This design is summarized below:

![MeetingParticipantClassDiagram](images/MeetingParticipantClassDiagram.png)

Users can directly modify the set of `Participants` of a `Meeting` during commands that allow them to specify
participant indexes, such as `AddMeetingCommand` and `EditMeetingCommand`. When entering these commands, the user optionally specifies the indexes of contacts in the
currently displayed contact list to participate in the meeting.  During such commands, the
general process of creating and adding `Participants` to a `Meeting`'s participant set is as follows:

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

1. If an index is specified, the validity of the index is checked.
    * If the index is invalid, the command execution is stopped.
    * If the index is valid, proceed to step 2.
2. The `Contact` specified by the index is obtained.
3. A `Participant` is created from the `Contact` and added to the `Meeting`'s participant set.
4. Repeat steps 1 to 3 for all indexes given by the user.

This process is summarised in the activity diagram below.

![CreateParticipantActivityDiagram](images/CreateParticipantActivityDiagram.png)

Another scenario when a `Meeting` may have its set of `Participants` modified is when a `Contact` object
is replaced by another `Contact` object in the `UniquePersonList` (ie. during the execution of `EditContactCommand`).
In this case, the `Participant` referencing the original `Contact` object is updated. Each `Meeting` that
this `Participant` participates in is replaced with a new `Meeting` containing the updated `Participant`.

It is important to note here that the **entire `UniqueMeetingList`** is looped through during this operation to check whether each `Meeting` is participated by this
`Participant`. The following activity diagram summarises this process:

![UpdateParticipantActivityDiagram](images/UpdateParticipantActivityDiagram.png)

Similarly, the deletion of a `Contact` from `UniquePersonList` during the execution of `DeleteContactCommand` also
updates participant sets by looping through the entire `UniqueMeetingList`. The process is identical to the above,
except that no replacement participant is created and added to the meeting's participant set.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Whether each `Contact` should keep track of a list of `Meetings` it participates in:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Contacts` do not keep track of the `Meetings` they participate in.
    * Pros: More testable. The `Contact` class does not depend on `Meeting`, which reduces the
      chance of regressions.
    * Cons: Slower as every meeting in the `UniqueMeetingList` must be checked whenever a `Contact`
      is updated or deleted. The poor performance would be noticeable when there is a large number of meetings scheduled.

* **Alternative 2:** Each `Contact` keeps track of the `Meetings` it participates in.
    * Pros: When updating or deleting contacts, the meetings whose participant sets need to be updated
      can be directly accessed from the contact. Thus, these operations are faster.
    * Cons: Harder to implement. Moreover, the `Meeting` and `Contact` classes will now depend on each other. The cyclic dependency makes the code
      less testable.

Reasons for choosing Alternative 1:
* It reduces regressions by preventing cyclic dependencies.
* The number of meetings that the target user (a busy NUS School of Computing student) would realistically schedule is
  not expected to be so large that the slower performance of alternative 1 is noticeable.
* Hence, testability was prioritised over performance.


### Find meeting feature

This section describes how the find meeting feature was implemented. This feature allows the user to find meetings by specifying
search terms for the name, date and/or tags of meetings.

#### Implementation

Similar to other commands, the user input (eg. `findm n/Alex d/22-02-2022`) is first parsed by the `FindMeetingCommandParser` to create a `FindMeetingCommand`,
which when executed will update the Model's `FilteredList` using `FilteredList#setPredicate`.

During the parsing, the user input is used to create an instance each of `MeetingNameHasKeywordsPredicate`, `MeetingTagHasKeywordsPredicate`
and `MeetingOccursOnDatesPredicate`. (Note that all 3 are created regardless of whether the user specified a search term of that type.)
The 3 classes implement the Java generic interface `Predicate<Meeting>` (see [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/Predicate.html) for documentation), with the `test` method implemented as follows:
* If no search terms of a type are specified by the user, the predicate corresponding to that type will always return true. For example, if the user does not specify any name or tag to search for, `MeetingNameHasKeywordsPredicate#test` and `MeetingTagHasKeywordsPredicate#test` return true for any meeting.
* If search terms of that type are specified, the predicate returns true if and only if the meeting being tested matches **at least one** of the search terms. For example, if the user specifies the dates `22-02-2022` and `11-04-2022`, `MeetingOccursOnDatesPredicate#test` will return true for meetings that occur on either date.

These 3 predicates are combined using the default method `Predicate#and`, thus allowing the user to combine searches of different types (e.g. searching for meetings occurring on specific days with the same tag). The predicate produced from `and` is then used as the argument for `FilteredList#setPredicate`.

The following sequence diagram summarises these interactions between the logic and model components when this feature is used:

![FindMeetingSequenceDiagram](images/FindMeetingSequenceDiagram.png)

**Note:** The lifeline for `FindMeetingCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Whether to allow multiple search terms of each type** (e.g. allow users to specify multiple dates to search for)

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow multiple search terms of each type.
    * Pros: More flexible for the user. Addresses legitimate user stories, e.g. users might want to view their schedule on multiple days at once to aid with their planning.
    * Cons: Manual testing is much more difficult due to the large increase in number of possible user inputs.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow only one search term per type.
    * Pros: Much easier to test manually due to the smaller number of possible inputs.
    * Cons: Less flexible for the user. Might not adequately address the problems they face in managing their academic/social life. E.g. separate searches are required to view schedule on different days; unable to view schedule across multiple days at once.

Reasons for choosing Alternative 1:
* It helps to solve problems faced by the user in a faster and more convenient way than alternative 2.
* The use of OOP through Java `Predicates` makes automated testing easier as we can test the `OR` behaviour
  within each predicate separately before testing the `AND` behaviour in `FindMeetingCommand`. This helps to partially make
  up for the relatively low manual testability compared to alternative 2.

### Reminder feature

This section describes how the reminder feature can be used for users to be reminded of meetings that will occur
within a certain time frame which the users can specify.

#### Implementation

The reminder feature uses the `ReminderDatePredicate`.The condition to locate the meetings is provided through this.
The meetings in AddresSoc are extracted and stored in the `FilteredList`.
It is then used to update `FilteredList` using `FilteredList#setPredicate`.
The updated `FilteredList` is then displayed.
This operation uses the `Model` for `Model#UpdateFilteredMeetingList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Reminder mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user keys in and executes the command `reminder 2` to locate all meetings within 2 days.
2. The command is parsed by `ReminderCommandParser`. The prefixes and their respective keywords are
   extracted and saved in an `ArgumentMultimap`.
3. The inputs are then checked for their validity. If no exceptions are detected, a `ReminderDatePredicate` and a `ReminderCommand` will be created.

4. The `ReminderCommand#execute` is called which updates the `FilteredList` that is currently being displayed.

The following sequence diagram shows how this works:

![ReminderSequenceDiagram](images/ReminderSequenceDiagram.png)

**Note:** The lifeline for `ReminderCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to allow users to receive reminders**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a `reminder` command that allows users to specify the number of days to
  return the result of upcoming meetings.
    * Pros:
        * Gives users flexibility in specifying the time frame they want to receive reminders for
        * Easy to implement.
    * Cons:
        * User has to manually specify number of days.

* **Alternative 2:** Set number of days reminders, so that when user call reminder command meetings
  upcoming in a fixed number of days will be displayed.
    * Pros:
        * User does not have to manually specify number of days since it is fixed.
    * Cons:
        * User has no flexibility to specify the time range to receive reminders for.

### Archive & Unarchive Features

#### Archive feature

This section describes how the archive feature can be used to be archive meetings that users do not
want to appear in the meeting list , but still want to save the data. There is an unarchive command
which is used to revert the archive command.

##### Implementation


![ArchiveActivityDiagram](images/ArchiveActivityDiagram.png)

Users can archive a specific meeting by entering the `archive index` command. The following steps describe how this
behaviour is implemented.

The archive feature uses the `ArchiveStatus`.The condition to is used to check whether the meeting
is already archived or not.
The meetings in AddresSoc are extracted and stored in the `FilteredList`.
It is then used to update `FilteredList` using `FilteredList#PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_MEETINGS`.
The updated `FilteredList` is then displayed.
This operation uses the `Model` for `Model#UpdateFilteredMeetingList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how this works:

![ArchiveSequenceDiagram](images/ArchiveSequenceDiagram.png)

**Note:** The lifeline for `ArchiveCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


1. The user archives a `Meeting` in the observable `MeetingList` with command `archive index`.The index is parsed and
   archive command is executed.

2. The meeting's `ArchiveStatus` will be checked . If it is true, an error message will be displayed.

3. Otherwise the meeting's `ArchiveStatus` will be set to true by the `Meeting#archive()` method.

4. The current `FilteredList` will be updated showing only the unarchived meetings, facilitated by
   `Model#PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_MEETINGS`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Unarchive feature

This section shows how the archive feature can be reverted. The user can use the unarchive command so
that the unarchived meeting appear in the meeting list.

##### Implementation


![UnArchiveActivityDiagram](images/UnArchiveActivityDiagram.png)

Users can unarchive a specific meeting by entering the `unarchive index` command. The following steps describe how this
behaviour is implemented.

The archive feature uses the `ArchiveStatus`.The condition to is used to check whether the meeting
is already archived or not.
The meetings in AddresSoc are extracted and stored in the `FilteredList`.
It is then used to update `FilteredList` using `FilteredList#PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_MEETINGS`.
The updated `FilteredList` is then displayed.
This operation uses the `Model` for `Model#UpdateFilteredMeetingList`.


1. The user unarchives a `Meeting` in the observable `archivelist` with command `unarchive index`.The index is parsed and
   unarchive command is executed.

2. The meeting's `ArchiveStatus` will be checked . If it is false, an error message will be displayed.

3. Otherwise the meeting's `ArchiveStatus` will be set to false by the `Meeting#archive()` method.

4. The current `FilteredList` will be updated showing all the unarchived meetings, facilitated by
   `Model#PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_MEETINGS`

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: [NUS School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) students who:

* have a need to manage a significant number of student contacts and meetings
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast and prefer typing to mouse interactions
* are reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: AddresSoC helps the student to
* keep track of the contacts of peers in the student's network,
* organize the contacts for easier lookup, and
* manage the student's social and academic life by keeping track of their schedule.

It completes these tasks faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
