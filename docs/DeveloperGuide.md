### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Manual Command

#### Description

The `manual` command displays the format and a short description for a particular command. During the execution of the `manual` command, the user's input is being parsed in `ManualCommandParser`. After which, a new `ManualCommand` object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Implementation
1. Upon receiving the user input, the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "manual", `ManualCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called. In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word "manual".
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    **Note:** A ParseException will be thrown if the argument is invalid.
    </div>

4. The supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
5. The `ManualCommandParser` will create a new `ManualCommand` (using the `argument` in Step 4), which will be returned to `LogicManager`.
6. The `LogicManager` will call `ManualCommand#execute(Model model)`. If the `argument` is invalid, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
7. Lastly, the `ManualCommand` will create a new `CommandResult` which will be returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the manual command works:

![ManualCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ManualCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### Mark Command

#### Description

The `mark` command marks a specific undone task as done for a particular student. During the execution of the `mark` command, the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`. After which, a new `MarkCommand` object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Implementation
1. Upon receiving the user input, the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "mark", `MarkCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called. In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word "mark".
4. In the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into a `ArgumentMultiMap`, by `using ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes)`.
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    **Note:** A ParseException will be thrown if the prefix of the compulsory fields are missing or if the arguments are invalid.
    </div>

5. The `MarkCommandParser` will pass the studentId input (found in the `ArgumentMultiMap`) into `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`.
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    **Note:** A NullException will be thrown if the supplied string argument is null.
    </div>

6. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
7. `StudentId#isValidId(String studentId)` will then be invoked, which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied). If the argument is valid, a new `StudentId` object will be created and returned to the `MarkCommandParser`. If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
8. The `MarkCommandParser` will pass the index input (found in the `ArgumentMultiMap`) into `ParserUtil#parseIndex(Index index)`.
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    **Note:** A NullException will be thrown if the supplied string argument is null.
    </div>

9. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(Index index)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
10. `Index#isValidId(Index index)` will then be invoked, which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied). If the argument is valid, a new `Index` object will be created and returned to the `MarkCommandParser`. If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
11. The `MarkCommandParser` will create a new `MarkCommand` object using the `StudentId` and `Index` created in Step 7 and 10 respectively.
12. The `LogicManager` will then call `MarkCommand#execute(Model model)`.
13. The `MarkCommand` will call `model#markTaskOfPerson(Student studentId, Index index)`, which marks the task (corresponding to the supplied index) of the given student as done.
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    **Note:** A CommandException will be thrown if the supplied index or studentId is invalid, or if the task is already marked as completed.
    </div>
    
14. Lastly, the `MarkCommand` will create a new `CommandResult`, which will be returned to `LogicManager`

The following sequence diagrams shows how the mark command works:

![MarkCommandSequenceDiagram](images/MarkCommandSequenceDiagram-2.png)

### Unmark Command

#### Description

The `unmark` command marks a specific done task as undone for a particular student. During the execution of the `unmark` command, the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`. After which, a new `UnmarkCommand` object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Implementation
1. Upon receiving the user input, the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "unmark", `UnmarkCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called. In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word "unmark".
4. In the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into a `ArgumentMultiMap`, by `using ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes)`.
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    **Note:** A ParseException will be thrown if the prefix of the compulsory fields are missing or if the arguments are invalid.
    </div>

5. The `UnmarkCommandParser` will pass the studentId input (found in the `ArgumentMultiMap`) into `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`.
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    **Note:** A NullException will be thrown if the supplied string argument is null.
    </div>

6. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
7. `StudentId#isValidId(String studentId)` will then be invoked, which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied). If the argument is valid, a new `StudentId` object will be created and returned to the `UnmarkCommandParser`. If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
8. The `UnmarkCommandParser` will pass the index input (found in the `ArgumentMultiMap`) into `ParserUtil#parseIndex(Index index)`.
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    **Note:** A NullException will be thrown if the supplied string argument is null.
    </div>

9. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(Index index)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
10. `Index#isValidId(Index index)` will then be invoked, which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied). If the argument is valid, a new `Index` object will be created and returned to the `UnmarkCommandParser`. If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
11. The `UnmarkCommandParser` will create a new `UnmarkCommand` object using the `StudentId` and `Index` created in Step 7 and 10 respectively.
12. The `LogicManager` will then call `UnmarkCommand#execute(Model model)`.
13. The `UnmarkCommand` will call `model#unmarkTaskOfPerson(Student studentId, Index index)`, which marks the task (corresponding to the supplied index) of the given student as undone.
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    **Note:** A CommandException will be thrown if the supplied index or studentId is invalid, or if the task is already marked as not complete.
    </div>

14. Lastly, the `UnmarkCommand` will create a new `CommandResult`, which will be returned to `LogicManager`

The following sequence diagrams shows how the unmark command works:

![UnmarkCommandSequenceDiagram](images/UnmarkCommandSequenceDiagram-2.png)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Add Command 

#### Description

The `add` command allows users to add a particular student into TAPA. 
Since not all fields are compulsory during the execution of the `add` command,
the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`. After which, a new `AddCommand`
object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Implementation

1. Upon receiving the user input, 
   the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "add", `AddCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called.
   In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word ("add").
4. In the `AddCommandParser#parse(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into a `ArgumentMultimap`, 
   by using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes)`.
   
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
    **Note:** A ParseException will be thrown if the prefix of the compulsory fields are missing.
    </div> 

5. The `AddCommandParser` will pass the studentId input (found in the `ArgumentMultimap`) 
   into `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`
   
   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   **Note:** A NullException will be thrown if the supplied string argument is null.
    </div> 
   
6. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
7. `StudentId#isValidId(String studentId)` will then be invoked, 
   which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied).
   If the argument is valid, a new `StudentId` object will be created and returned to the `AddCommandParser`.
   If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
8. Step 5 to 7 will be repeated for the other compulsory fields (name, moduleCode) 
   and optional fields (phone, telegramHandle, email), by using their respective parse methods in `ParserUtil`.
   

   ![ParserUtilClassDiagram](images/ParserUtilClassDiagram.png)


   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   **Note:** If an optional field is not supplied (i.e. not found in the ArgumentMultimap), 
   the extra parsing process in steps 5 to 7 will be skipped. 
   Instead, the respective object will be created and initialized to `null`.
    </div> 

9. The `AddCommandParser` will create a new `Person`.
10. A new `AddCommand` will be created (using the `Person` in Step 9) and returned to the `LogicManager`.
11. The `LogicManager` will then call `AddCommand#execute(Model model)`.
12. In the `AddCommand`, the `model#hasPerson(Person person)` will be invoked. If the `Person` already exist
    in TAPA, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
    **Note:** In TAPA, two Person are equal only if they have the same studentId.
    </div> 
    
13. The `AddCommand` will call `model.addPerson(Person person)`, which adds the `Person` into the `AddressBook`.
14. Lastly, the `AddCommand` will create a new `CommandResult`, which will be returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

![AddCommandSequenceDiagram-1](images/AddCommandSequenceDiagram-1.png)

![AddCommandSequenceDiagram-2](images/AddCommandSequenceDiagram-2.png)

### Task Command

#### Description

The `task` command allows users to check and view all the tasks belonging to a particular student.
During the execution of the `task` command, the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`.
After which, a new `TaskCommand` object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the LogicManager.

#### Implementation

1. Upon receiving the user input,
   the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AdddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "task", `TaskCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called.
   In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word ("task").
4. In the `TaskCommandParser#parse(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into a `ArgumentMultimap`,
   by using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefex... prefixes)`.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
    **Note:** A ParseException will be thrown if the prefix of `StudentId` is missing, as it is a compulsory field.
   </div>

5. The `TaskCommandParser` will pass the studentId input (found in the `ArgumentMultimap`)
   into `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId).`

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   **Note:** A NullException will be thrown if the supplied string argument is null.
   </div>

6. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
7. `StudentId#isValidId(String studentId)` will then be invoked,
   which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied).
   If the argument is valid, a new StudentId object will be created and returned to the `TaskCommandParser`.
   If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
8. A new `TaskCommand` will be created (using the `StudentId` object created in Step 7) and returned to the `LogicManager`.
9. The `LogicManager` will then call `TaskCommand#execute(Model model)`.
10. In the `TaskCommand`, a `StudentIdContainsKeywordsPredicate` is created using the studentId.
11. The `model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` is then invoked such that the list is filtered by the predicate created.
12. The `model#getFilteredPersonList()` is then called. 
    The size of the resulting list determines if there is any `Person` that corresponds to the specified `studentId`. 
    If the size is equals to 0, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
    **Note:** The studentId is a UNIQUE field in TAPA.
    </div>

13. The `Person` object in the filtered list is then extracted out using `model#getFilteredPersonList().get(0)`.
14. The `TaskList` belong to this `Person` can then be retrieved using `Person#getTaskList()`.
15. If this `TaskList` is null or empty, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
16. The `TaskCommand` iterates through this `TaskList`, and categorises the tasks into two new `TaskList`
    according to the task's completion status.
17. Lastly, the `TaskCommand` will create a new `CommandResult` by using the `TaskList` in Step 16.
    This `CommandResult` will then be returned to `LogicManager`.

![TaskCommandSequenceDiagram-3](images/TaskCommandSequenceDiagram-3.png)

### Find Command

#### Description

The `find` command allows users to add a particular student into TAPA.
Since not all fields are compulsory during the execution of the `find` command,
the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`. After which, a new `FindCommand`
object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Implementation

1. Upon receiving the user input,
   the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "find", `FindCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called.
   In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word ("find").
4. In the `FindCommandParser#parse(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into a `ArgumentMultimap`,
   by using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes)`.

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
    **Note:** A ParseException will be thrown if the prefix of the compulsory fields are missing.
    </div> 

5. The `FindCommandParser` will pass the studentId input (found in the `ArgumentMultimap`)
   into `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   **Note:** A NullException will be thrown if the supplied string argument is null.
    </div> 

6. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
7. `StudentId#isValidId(String studentId)` will then be invoked,
   which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied).
   If the argument is valid, a new `StudentId` object will be created and returned to the `AddCommandParser`.
   If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   **Note:** The above description for Steps 5 to 7 is specifically for when studentId is used as the input field.
   Depending on the type of input field used (studentId, name, moduleCode), Steps 5 to 7 will 
   be executed using the parse methods in `ParserUtil` that are specific to the field.
    </div>

8. The `FindCommandParser` will create a new `Predicate`.
9. A new `FindCommand` will be created (using the `Predicate` in Step 8) and returned to the `LogicManager`.
10. The `LogicManager` will then call `FindCommand#execute(Model model)`.
11. In the `FindCommand`, the `model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)` will be invoked, which
    updates the filter of the person list to filter by the given `Predicate`.
12. Lastly, the `FindCommand` will create a new `CommandResult`, which will be returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:
