## **Introduction**

Teaching Assistant Contact Helper (TACH) is a desktop application for Computer Science (CS) Teaching Assistants (TAs) in National University of Singapore (NUS) to manage their students. The
application is highly optimised for users who can type fast as it is based on the Command Line Interface (CLI). Thus,
the main interaction with TACH will be done through user text-based commands.

This developer’s guide assumes its readers to have a basic understanding of programming.

The purpose of this Developer Guide is to help readers understand the design and implementation of TACH, so that
any reader who is interested can become a contributor to this project as well.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png"/>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

Go back to **[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)**

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `TutorialGroup` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Student` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `TutorialGroup` object per unique tutorial group, instead of each `Student` needing their own `TutorialGroup` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Telegram and GitHub attribute implementations

The diagram below shows that a `Student` may or may not have a `Telegram` and a `Github`.

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

Students with empty
`GitHub` and `Telegram` are stored using `GitHub` and `Telegram` instantiated with empty strings as shown below.

<img src="images/StudentWithEmptyTelegramAndGitHub.png" width="900" />

#### How it works

Below is a sequence diagram for `addStudentCommand`. The command was implemented such that all inputs have to be parsed by the respective methods of `ParserUtil`.

<img src="images/AddStudentSequenceDiagram.png" width="900" />

>**Note:** parseGitHub and parseTelegram methods now accommodate null as inputs.<br/>
> Here is a snippet for parseGitHub. parseTelegram has a similar format as well.
> ```
> public static GitHub parseGitHub(String gitHub) throws ParseException {
>     if (gitHub == null) {
>         return new GitHub(null);
>     }
>     String trimmedGitHub = gitHub.trim();
>     if (!GitHub.isValidGitHub(trimmedGitHub)) {
>         throw new ParseException(GitHub.MESSAGE_CONSTRAINTS);
>     }
>     return new GitHub(trimmedGitHub);
> }
> ```

GitHub and Telegram objects instantiated with null inputs have a value of ""
Here is a snippet for the constructor of Telegram. GitHub also have a similar format.
```
public Telegram(String telegram) {
    if (telegram == null) { //if telegram is empty it will exist as an empty string
        value = "";
    } else {
        checkArgument(isValidTelegram(telegram), MESSAGE_CONSTRAINTS);
        value = telegram;
    }
}
```

This means that an empty `GitHub` object will have a "" value and a `GitHub` object with a value of "" means that it is an empty `GitHub` object. The same logic applies to `Telegram` objects as well.

#### Why it works

As shown in the previous sequence diagram, `ParserUtil` parses all the inputs for the add command. Thus, an empty string (i.e. "") will be parsed though the method isValidXX, where XX is an attribute i.e. isValidName. All empty string will throw an error in any of parse methods in `ParserUtil`. Thus, an empty string will never be able to be accepted through the user input. Therefore, an empty string was used as a means to identify and instantiate attributes that can be empty (e.g. GitHub and Telegram).

#### Design considerations regarding how empty GitHub and Telegram should be stored

* Alternative 1: Stored as null
  * Pros: Easy to implement
  * Cons: NullPointerException can occur if `.toString()`of null is called

* Alternative 2: Stored as a reserved valid string e.g. "null"
  * Pros: Avoid NullPointerExceptions
  * Cons: Possibility of a student whose telegram or github be the string "null".

* Alternative 3 (Current Choice): Stored as an invalid string i.e. ""
  * Pros: Avoid NullPointerExceptions
  * Cons: We must ensure that the conversion from Object to Json and vice-versa must be correct.

### `addtg` feature

The `addtg` command adds tutorial group(s) to a student

The *add tutorial group(s) to a student* mechanism is facilitated by the `LogicManager` and the `AddressBookParser`. It is implemented by adding the parser class `AddTutorialGroupParser` and the command class `AddTutorialGroupCommand`.

```
command format: addtg INDEX tg/TUTORIAL_GROUP...
```
#### How `addtg` command is parsed and executed

Assuming the command is valid and execution is successful,

1. `LogicManager` is called to execute the command, using the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the
   command.
2. `AddressBookParser` sees that the command has the valid starting command word `addtg` and creates a
   new `AddTutorialGroupParser` that parses the command.
3. `AddTutorialGroupParser` confirms the command is valid and returns a `AddTutorialGroupCommand` to
   be executed by the `LogicManager`
4. `LogicManager` executes `AddTutorialGroupCommand`, which gets the relevant information from the
   `Model` component, getting the filtered student list and acquiring the student at the specified `Index`.
5. `AddTutorialGroupCommand` creates a new `Student` combining the existing and newly specified `TUTORIAL_GROUP(s)` and returns the relevant `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`

Rationale:
- A new `Student` is created with the new combined information instead of adding the new tutorial group(s) to the existing `Student` because a `Student` object is immutable.
- An `Index` based on the current list shown is used to specify which `Student` will be updated. An alternative would be to use the name of the student instead of an index. However, an index makes it easier and faster for users to key in the command as it is way shorter (length) as compared to a student's name.
  - Hence, to increase efficiency of TACH, we have chosen `index` to be our indicator.

#### Example usage scenario and how the `addtg` mechanism behaves

When the user executes `addtg 2 tg/CS2103T W15-3 tg/CS2101 G08` command to add a tutorial group to the 2nd student listed in the address book.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addtg` operation works:

<img src="images/AddTutorialGroupSequenceDiagram.png" width="900" />

The following diagram shows a brief overview of the AddTutorialGroupDescriptor created shown in the `addtg` sequence diagram above

### `deletetg` feature

The `deletetg` command deletes a tutorial group from a student.

The *deleting a tutorial group from student* mechanism is facilitated by the `LogicManger` and the
`AddressBookParser`. It is implemented by adding the parser class `DeleteTutorialGroupParser` and the
command class `DeleteTutorialGroupCommand`.

```
command format: deletetg INDEX tg/TUTORIAL_GROUP
```

#### How `deletetg` command is parsed and executed

Assuming the command is valid and execution is successful,

1. `LogicManager` is called to execute the command, using the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the
command.
2. `AddressBookParser` sees that the command has the valid starting command word `deletetg` and creates a
new `DeleteTutorialGroupParser` that parses the command.
3. `DeleteTutorialGroupParser` confirms the command is valid and returns a `DeleteTutorialGroupCommand` to
be executed by the `LogicManager`
4. `LogicManager` executes `DeleteTutorialGroupCommand`, which gets the relevant information from the
`Model` component, getting the filtered student list and acquiring the student at the specified `Index`.
5. `DeleteTutorialGroupCommand` deletes the specified `TUTORIAL_GROUP` of the student and returns the relevant `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`

Sequence Diagram:

<img src="images/DeleteTutorialGroupSequenceDiagram.png" width="900" />

<br>

This feature was implemented to follow this sequence to keep it consistent with the rest of the `Command`s
and `Parser`s.

#### A few interesting details regarding how `deletetg` command works

- The command takes in an `Index` instead of a student's name because we felt that it was much easier to
type in a number than the entirety of someone's name. It is also distinct and much less vague.


- Only one tutorial group can be deleted at a time. If a student has some tutorial groups but not all
tutorial groups to be deleted, what should the command do? Making it such that only one tutorial group can
be deleted at a time prevents ambiguity in contrast to if several tutorial groups can be deleted at a time.


- If the tutorial group to be deleted is the only one that the student has, the command will not work. A
student must have at least one tutorial group. If this were not the case, it could result in some serious
buggy behaviours regarding other commands involving tutorial groups.


- The tutorial group must be typed exactly, but is case-insensitive. <br> An alternative would be to
indicate an `Index` instead of the exact tutorial group, but that would mean we would either have to
display an overall index of all the modules, or display an index of all the modules for each student.
Either way it would make the UI more complex and cluttered. <br> This is why we decided to make it such
that it must be typed exactly, but is case-insensitive, since two tutorial groups should be the same if
only their cases are different.

### `findtg` feature

The `findtg` command will list all students in a particular tutorial group.

The *find a tutorial group* mechanism is facilitated by the `LogicManger` and the
`AddressBookParser`. It is implemented by adding the parser class `FindTutorialGroupParser`, the
command class `FindTutorialGroupCommand` and the model class `TutorialGroupKeywordsPredicate`.

```
command format: findtg TUTORIAL_GROUP
```

#### How `findtg` command is parsed and executed

Assuming the command is valid and execution is successful,

1. `LogicManager` is called to execute the command, using the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the
   command.
2. `AddressBookParser` sees that the command has the valid starting command word `findtg` and creates a
   new `FindTutorialGroupParser` that parses the command.
3. `FindTutorialGroupParser` confirms the command is valid and returns a `FindTutorialGroupCommand` to
   be executed by the `LogicManager`
4. `FindTutorialGroupCommand` passes the specified `TUTORIAL_GROUP` name to `TutorialGroupKeywordsPredicate` to 
filter out all students with the specified `TUTORIAL_GROUP` name
5. `LogicManager` executes `FindTutorialGroupCommand`, which gets the relevant information from the
   `Model` component, getting the filtered student list.
6. `FindTutorialGroupCommand` filter out all students in the specified `TUTORIAL_GROUP` and returns the relevant 
`CommandResult` to `LogicManager`

#### Example usage scenario and how the *findtg* mechanism behaves

When the user executes `findtg CS2100 T05` command to find a tutorial group.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `findtg` operation works:

<img src="images/FindTutorialGroupSequenceDiagram.png" width="900" />

There are a few interesting details as to how the command works:

- The tutorial group must be typed exactly, but is case-insensitive. Since it is more convenience for user to type and
  two tutorial groups should be the same if only their cases are different.

- If there are no matching tutorial group found in the students, the command will return an empty student list

- `findtg` do not support find partial keyword to prevent ambiguity and TAs usually teach a single module with multiple
tutorial group. This operation is provided for users to sort students by their specified tutorial group

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a student

1. Deleting a student while all students are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all students using the `list` command. Multiple students in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First student is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted student shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No student is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Finding a tutorial group

1. Finding students from a particular tutorial group while all students are being shown
   1. Prerequisites: Multiple students are added to a tutorial group eg:`CS2103T W15`.

   2. Test case: `findtg CS2103T W15`<br>
      Expected: all students added to the tutorial group `CS2103T W15` are listed out. Number of students listed out are shown in the status message.

   3. Test case: `findtg CS2103T`<br>
      Expected: No student listed. Since user only input module code without tutorial group details. All invalid entry of tutorial group or no matching tutorial group will result in no student listed.

### Dealing with corrupted data files

* Troubleshooting with corrupted files:
   1. Prerequisite: Corrupted data file.
       * To simulate a corrupted data file:
         * Open the data folder in the folder where TACH is in. Edit addressbook.json and change one of the fields to an invalid one 
         e.g. Add a `!` at the end of Irfan's email.
           i.e. change from
             > "name" : "Irfan Ibrahim",
             <br>"telegram" : "@irfan201",
             <br>"email" : "irfan@hotmail.com",
             <br>"gitHub" : "",
             <br>"inTutorialGroups" : [ "CS2106 T01" ]

            to
            > "name" : "Irfan Ibrahim",
            <br>"telegram" : "@irfan201",
            <br>"email" : "irfan@hotmail.com!",
            <br>"gitHub" : "",
            <br>"inTutorialGroups" : [ "CS2106 T01" ]
      
            > **NOTE:** If there is no data file, open TACH and enter the command `list`. The data file should appear in the folder where TACH is in.
   2. Test case: Corrupted data file 
   <br>Open the data folder in the folder where TACH is in. Edit all the data such that it meets the requirement stated here.[Input Requirements](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w15-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#input-requirements) 
   <br> Expected: TACH will now load the data file and not an empty one.
      * Example: To resolve the issue in step i, change Irfan's email from an invalid one (`irfan@hotmail.com!`) 
      to a valid one (`irfan@hotmail.com`) by removing the `!` at the end. i.e.
         <br>change from :
          > "name" : "Irfan Ibrahim",
          <br>"telegram" : "@irfan201",
          <br>"email" : "irfan@hotmail.com!",
          <br>"gitHub" : "",
          <br>"inTutorialGroups" : [ "CS2106 T01" ]
   
         to
         > "name" : "Irfan Ibrahim",
         <br>"telegram" : "@irfan201",
         <br>"email" : "irfan@hotmail.com",
         <br>"gitHub" : "",
         <br>"inTutorialGroups" : [ "CS2106 T01" ]
