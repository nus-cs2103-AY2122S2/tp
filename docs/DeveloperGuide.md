### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `GroupListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. 
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. 
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Group` objects residing in the `Model` 

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the ArchDuke data i.e., all `Person`, `Group`, `Task` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList`, `UniqueGroupList`, `UniqueTaskList` objects respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Group` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Group>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both ArchDuke data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

## Delete student contact feature

### About delete student contact feature

The delete student contact feature allows users to delete an existing student contact from the student contact list
via the command `delete INDEX`.

### How it is implemented

The `delete` command mechanism is facilitated by the `DeleteCommand` and the `DeleteCommandParser`.
It allows users to delete a student contact from the student contact list.
It uses the `AddressBook#removePerson(Person key)` which is exposed in the `Model`
interface as `Model#deletePerson(Person personToDelete)`. Then, the `remove(Person person)` is called on the `UniquePersonList`
in `AddressBook` to delete the student contact from the list. <br>

A modification from AB3 delete mechanism is that the `delete` command also involves the facilitation of the `AddressBook#deassignPerson(Person persontToDeassign, Group group)`
which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deassignPerson(Person person, Group group)`, which result in the call of `Group#deassign(Person person)` to 
deassign the deleted student contact from all previously assigned groups.

#### Parsing user input

1. The user inputs the `delete` command.

2. The `ArchDukeParser` then preliminary process the user input and creates a new `DeleteCommandParser`.

3. The `DeleteCommandParser` then calls the `ParserUtil#parseIndex()` to check for the validity of the `INDEX`. 
At this stage, if the `INDEX is invalid or is not present`, `ParseException` would be thrown.

4. The `DeleteCommandParser` then creates the `DeleteCommand` based on the processed input.

#### Command execution

5. The `LogicManager` executes the `DeleteCommand`.

6. The `DeleteCommand` calls the `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` to get the unmodifiable view of the filtered person list to get the target 
person to delete based on the provided `INDEX`. <br><br> At this stage, `CommandException` would be thrown if the input `INDEX` 
is invalid (i.e. `INDEX` exceeds the size of the student contact list). 

7. The `DeleteCommand` the calls the `Model#deletePerson(Person personToDelete)` to delete the target student contact from the 
student contact list.

8. After which, the `Model#getFilteredGroupList()` is called to get the unmodifiable view of the filtered group list.

9. The iteration through the groups in the obtained group list is being done to check if the target student contact was assigned 
to the groups. `Model#deassignPerson(Person person, Group group)` is called to deassign the student contact from all previously assigned groups. 

#### Displaying of result

10. Finally, the `DeleteCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with a success message and return it to the `LogicManager` to complete the command execution.
   The GUI would also be updated on this change in the student contact list and group list and update the display of group list accordingly.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `delete` mechanism works:

![](images/DeleteUpdatedSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `delete` command:

![](images/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.png)

## Add group feature

### About add group feature

The add group feature allows users to create a has-yet-to-exist student group in the student group list via the command 
`addgroup g/GROUP_NAME`.

### How it is implemented

The `addgroup` command mechanism is facilitated by the `AddGroupCommand` and the `AddGroupCommandParser`.
It allows users to add a not-already-existing-group to the ArchDuke student group list. 
It uses the `AddressBook#addGroup(Group group)` which is exposed in the `Model` 
interface as `Model#addGroup(Group group)`. Then, the `add(Group groupToAdd)` is called on the `UniqueGroupList`
in `AddressBook` to add the group to the group list.

Given below is the example usage scenario and how the add group mechanism behaves at each step.

#### Parsing user input

1. The user inputs the `addgroup` command and provides the `GROUP_NAME` of the group in which the user wants to add.

2. The `ArchDukeParser` then does preliminary processing to the user input and creates a new `AddGroupCommandParser`.

3. The `AddGroupCommandParser` then parses the user input and checks whether all the input attributes are present by checking the presence of the prefixes. 
It also checks whether the command is in the correct format. In this case, the required prefix and attribute is `g/GROUP_NAME`. <br> <br> At this stage, if not all the prefixes are present, 
`ParseException` would be thrown.

4. If the required prefixes and attributes are present (i.e. `g/GROUP_NAME`), `AddGroupCommandParser` will then call the `ParserUtil#parseGroupName()` 
method to check for the validity of the input `GROUP_NAME`. <br> <br> At this stage, `ParseException` would be thrown if the 
`GROUP_NAME` specified is invalid.

5. The `AddGroupCommandParser` then creates the `AddGroupCommand` based on the processed input.

#### Command execution

6. The `LogicManager` executes the `AddGroupCommand`.

7. The `AddGroupCommand` calls the `Model#hasGroup()` to check if the group with the same `GROUP_NAME` has already existed in the group list. 
`CommandException` would be thrown if there already existed a group with the same group name.

8. The `AddGroupCommand` then calls the `Model#addGroup()` to add the input group to the list.

#### Displaying of result

9. Finally, the `AddGroupCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with a success message and return it to the `LogicManager` to complete the command execution. 
The GUI would also be updated on this change in the group list and update the display of group list accordingly.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addgroup` mechanism works:

## Delete group feature

### About delete group feature

The delete group feature allows users to delete an existing student group in 
the student group list via the command `delgroup g/GROUP_NAME`.

### How it is implemented

The `delgroup` command mechanism is facilitated by the `DeleteGroupCommand` and the `DeleteGroupCommandParser`. 
It allows users to delete an already-existing-group from the ArchDuke student group list. It uses the `AddressBook#removeGroup(Group key)`
which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteGroup(Group target)`. Then, the `remove(Group toRemove)` is called on the `UniqueGroupList`
to remove the group from the group list.

Given below is the example usage scenario and how the delete group mechanism behaves at each step.

#### Parsing user input

1. The user inputs the `delgroup` command and provide the `GROUP_NAME` of the group in which the user wants to remove.

2. The `ArchDukeParser` then does preliminary processing to the user input and creates a new `DeleteGroupCommandParser`.

3. The `DeleteGroupCommandParser` then parses the user input and check whether all the input attributes are present by checking the presence of the prefixes.
    It also checks whether the command is in the correct format. In this case, the required prefix and attribute is `g/GROUP_NAME`. <br> <br> At this stage, if not all the prefixes are present,
   `ParseException` would be thrown.

4. If the required prefixes and attributes are present (i.e. `g/GROUP_NAME`), `DeleteGroupCommandParser` will then call the `ParserUtil#parseGroupName()`
   method to check for the validity of the input `GROUP_NAME`. <br> <br> At this stage, `ParseException` would be thrown if the
   `GROUP_NAME` specified is invalid.

5. The `DeleteGroupCommandParser` then creates the `DeleteGroupCommand` based on the processed input.

#### Command execution

6. The `LogicManager` executes the `DeleteGroupCommand`.

7. The `DeleteGroupCommand` calls the `Model#getFilteredGroupList()` to get the current unmodifiable view of the filtered group list.

8. The `DeleteGroupCommand` calls the `contains()` method on the obtained filtered group list to check if the group with the same `GROUP_NAME` existed in the group list.
      `CommandException` would be thrown if there exists no group with the same group name.

9. The `DeleteGroupCommand` then calls the `Model#deleteGroup()` to delete the input group to from the group list.

#### Displaying of result

10. Finally, the `DeleteGroupCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with a success message and return it to the `LogicManager` to complete the command execution.
    The GUI would also be updated on this change in the group list and update the display of group list accordingly.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `delgroup` mechanism works:

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteGroupCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `delgroup` command:

![](images/DeleteGroupCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Design considerations

#### Aspect: What the delgroup command deletes by

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Deletes a group by the group name.

  * Pros: It is more intuitive as user who wants to delete a group would **already know** what group he/she wants to delete, and hence the group name.
  Users would not have to search through the group list to see which index the group he/she wants to delete is located. 
  Searching through the list may be especially troublesome if there are many groups in the group list.
  
  * Cons: User would have to type the entire group name.
  
* **Alternative 2**: Deletes a group by the index of the group in the list.

  * Pros: Users could delete the group by just typing a single number. This may be faster if the group is already visible in the group list without having to search
    (e.g. when the target group to delete is at the top of the list).
  
  * Cons: If there are many groups in the group list, users would have to execute another command (i.e. to find the group to get the group index) 
  before being able to delete the desired group.

#### Aspect: Allowing reference to group name to be case-insensitive

The implementation takes in user experience as one of the most important decision when deciding how a feature should behave. 
Since the implementation chooses to delete a group by its group name, there was a concern about the user having to type possibly lengthy
group name to refer to the target group to delete. <br>

To enhance the user experience for the target group (i.e. fast typists), the reference to the group is designed such that it is case-insensitive.
This means that the users would not need to worry about cases as long as the spelling and spacing are correct. 
The aim is to make reference to the target group as easy as possible and to minimize typo errors.

## Add task to an existing group feature

### About add task feature

The add task feature allows users to add a yet-to-exist task to an existing
student group via the command `addtask task/TASK_NAME g/GROUP_NAME`.

### How it is implemented

The `addtask` command mechanism is facilitated by the `AddTaskCommand` and the `AddTaskCommandParser`.
It allows users to add a yet-to-exist task to an already existing group in ArchDuke. It uses the `AddressBook#addTassk(Task task, Group group)`
which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addTask(Task task, Group group)`. Then, the `getGroup(Group group)` is called on the `UniqueGroupList` to get the target group,
and `Group#addTask(Task task)` is called on the target group to add the task to the group.

Given below is the example usage scenario and how add task mechanism behaves at each step.

#### Parsing user input

1. The user inputs the `addtask` command and provide the `TASK_NAME` and `GROUP_NAME` of the task and group
in which the user wants to add.

2. The `ArchDukeParser` then does preliminary processing to the user input and creates a new `AddTaskCommandParser`.

3. The `AddTaskCommandParser` then parses the user input and check whether all the input attributes are present by checking the presence of the prefixes.
   It also checks whether the command is in the correct format. In this case, the required prefix and attribute are `task/TASK_NAME` and `g/GROUP_NAME`. <br> <br> At this stage, if not all the prefixes are present,
   `ParseException` would be thrown.

4. If the required prefixes and attributes are present (i.e. `task/TASK_NAME` and `g/GROUP_NAME`), `AddTaskCommandParser` will then call the `ParserUtil#parseGroupName()`
   and `ParseUtil#parseTaskName()` to check for the validity of the input `TASK_NAME` and `GROUP_NAME`. <br> <br> At this stage, `ParseException` would be thrown if the
   `GROUP_NAME` and/or `TASK_NAME` specified is invalid.

5. The `AddTaskCommandParser` then creates the `AddTaskCommand` based on the processed inputs.

#### Command execution

6. The `LogicManager` executes the `AddTaskCommand`.

7. The `AddTaskCommand` calls the `Model#hasGroup()` to check if the group with the same `GROUP_NAME` has existed in the group list.
   `CommandException` would be thrown if there has yet to exist a group with the same group name. 

8. Similarly, the `AddTaskCommand` then call the `Model#hasTask()` to check if the task with the same `TASK_NAME` has already existed in that group.
`CommandException` would be thrown if there is already a task with the same task name in the group.

9. `AddTaskCommand` then call the static `createAddedTaskGroup(Group groupToAddTask, Task taskToAdd, Model model)` to create a new `Group` with the task added.
The task is added through the call of `Model#addTask()` by `AddTaskCommand`.

10. `AddTaskCommand` then call `Model#setGroup(Group target, Group editedGroup)` to replace the old target group with the new group with the task added. 
This will update the `UniqueGroupList` of the new `Group` with the task added.

#### Displaying of result

11. Finally, the `AddTaskCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with a success message and return it to the `LogicManager` to complete the command execution.
    The GUI would also be updated on this change in the group list and update the display of group list accordingly.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addtask` mechanism works:

![](images/AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddTaskCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `addtask` command:

![](images/AddTaskCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Design considerations

#### Aspect: Allowing reference to task name to be case-insensitive

As users are required to type the entire task name to reference a task (i.e. in `addtask` and subsequently in `deltask` commands), 
the reference to a task is implemented in such a way to minimise typo errors and to facilitate target users (i.e. fast typists).
By making the task name case-insensitive, users can easily refer to the particular task so long as the spelling and spacing is correct.

## View task feature

### About view task feature

The view task feature allows users to view tasks in an existing 
student group via the command `viewtask g/GROUP_NAME`.

### How it is implemented

The `viewtask` command mechanism is facilitated by the `ViewTaskCommand` and the `ViewTaskCommandParser`.
It allows users to view tasks in an already existing group in ArchDuke. It uses the `AddressBook#viewTassk(Group group)`
which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#viewTask(Group group)`. Then, the `getGroup(Group group)` is called on the `UniqueGroupList` to get the target group,
and `Group#viewTask()` is called on the target group to view tasks in the group.

Given below is the example usage scenario and how view task mechanism behaves at each step.

#### Parsing user input

1. The user inputs the `viewtask` command and provide the `GROUP_NAME` of the group
   in which the user wants to view tasks.

2. The `ArchDukeParser` then does preliminary processing to the user input and creates a new `ViewTaskCommandParser`.

3. The `ViewTaskCommandParser` then parses the user input and check whether all the input attributes are present by checking the presence of the prefixes.
   It also checks whether the command is in the correct format. In this case, the required prefix and attribute is `g/GROUP_NAME`. <br> <br> At this stage, if not all the prefixes are present,
   `ParseException` would be thrown.

4. If the required prefixes and attributes is present (i.e. `g/GROUP_NAME`), `ViewTaskCommandParser` will then call the `ParserUtil#parseGroupName()`
   to check for the validity of the input `GROUP_NAME`. <br> <br> At this stage, `ParseException` would be thrown if the
   `GROUP_NAME` specified is invalid.

5. The `ViewTaskCommandParser` then creates the `ViewTaskCommand` based on the processed inputs.

#### Command execution

6. The `LogicManager` executes the `ViewTaskCommand`.

7. The `ViewTaskCommand` calls the `Model#hasGroup()` to check if the group with the same `GROUP_NAME` has existed in the group list.
   `CommandException` would be thrown if there has yet to exist a group with the same group name.

8. The `ViewTaskCommand` then calls the `Model#viewTask(Group group)` to generate the `String` output of the tasks in the group's task list.

#### Displaying of result

9. Finally, the `ViewTaskCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with the previously generated `String` as message and return it to the `LogicManager` to complete the command execution.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `viewtask` mechanism works:

## Assign student contact to an existing group feature

### About assign feature

The assign feature allows users to assign a yet-to-assign student contact to an existing
student group via the command `assign INDEX g/GROUP_NAME`.

### How it is implemented

The `assign` command mechanism is facilitated by the `AssignCommand` and the `AssignCommandParser`.
It allows users to add a yet-to-assign student contact to an already existing group in ArchDuke. It uses the `AddressBook#assignPerson(Person personToAssign, Group group)`
which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#assignPerson(Person person, Group group)`. Then, the `Group#AssignPerson(Person person)` is called to 
assign a person to the group. 

Given below is the example usage scenario and how assign mechanism behaves at each step.

#### Parsing user input

1. The user inputs the `assign` command and provide the `INDEX` of the student contact and `GROUP_NAME` of the group
in which the users want to assign the student contact to.

2. The `ArchDukeParser` then does preliminary processing to the user input and creates a new `AssignCommandParser`.

3. The `AassignCommandParser` then parses the user input and check whether all the input attributes are present by checking the presence of the prefixes.
   It also checks whether the command is in the correct format. In this case, the required prefix and attribute is `g/GROUP_NAME`. <br> <br> At this stage, if not all the prefixes are present,
   `ParseException` would be thrown. 

4. If the required prefixes and attributes is present (i.e. `g/GROUP_NAME`), `AssignCommandParser` will then call the `ParserUtil#parseGroupName()`
   to check for the validity of the input `GROUP_NAME`. It also calls the `ParserUtil#parseIndex()` to check for the validity of the `INDEX`.
   <br> <br> At this stage, `ParseException` would be thrown if the
   `GROUP_NAME` specified is invalid and/or the `INDEX` is invalid.

5. The `AssignCommandParser` then creates the `AssignCommand` based on the processed inputs.

#### Command execution

6. The `LogicManager` executes the `AssignCommand`.

7. The `AssignCommand` calls the `Model#hasGroup()` to check if the group with the same `GROUP_NAME` has existed in the group list.
   `CommandException` would be thrown if there has yet to exist a group with the same group name. Subsequently, `Model#getFilteredGroupList()`
is called to get the unmodifiable view of the group list. The list is then being looped through to obtain the target group.

8. Similarly, `AssignCommand` calls the `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` and get the target student contact by index.

9. `AssignCommand` calls `Group#personExists` on the target group to check if the student contact has already existed in the group.
`CommandException` is thrown if there exists the same person in the group.

10. The `Model#assignPerson(Person person, Group group)` is called to assign the student contact to the target group.

#### Displaying of result

11. Finally, the `AssignCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with a success message and return it to the `LogicManager` to complete the command execution.
     The GUI would also be updated on this change in the group list and update the display of group list accordingly.

### Design considerations

#### Aspect: What the assign command assigns student contact by

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Assigns by student contact index.

    * Pros: It is fast as the users could just refer to the student contact by a number. This makes the command very short
    as compared to having to type out the student contact's name etc.

    * Cons: If there exists many student contacts in the student contact list, users would have to search through the list to 
    obtain the index of the student contact that the users want to assign to a group. This may result in an additional step of 
    filtering through the list via other commands to obtain the target student contact.

* **Alternative 2**: Assigns by student contact name.

    * Pros: It is arguably more intuitive as the users would already know the name of the student contact in which the users 
    want to assign to the group. 

    * Cons: It may result in long commands as users would have to type in the student contact's name.
  
    * Limitations: Although the reference to the student contact by name might be more intuitive and is a closer representation of 
    how a person is being referred to in the real-world, the current limitation of the app makes it impossible to refer to a student contact
    solely by his name. This is because the current implementation of the app allows any two users to have the same name (i.e. name is not
  a unique identifier of a student contact). In the current implementation, a student contact is uniquely identified by `EMAIL` and/or `PHONE_NUMBER`.
    Hence, reference to a student contact by his name is impossible due to possible duplications in their names.

## Find student contact feature

### About find contact feature

The `find` command allows the search of a contact by attributes via the command `find KEYWORDS` where `KEYWORDS` can be either `NAME` , `PHONE`, `EMAIL`, `ACADEMIC MAJOR` or `TAGS`

### How it is implemented
The feature is made possible through introducing an `AttributeContainsKeywordsPredicate` interface which is
implemented by all the `Person`'s attributes. Hence, there are more classes being introduced -
`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `PhoneContainsKeywordsPredicate` and so on.

Given below is the example usage scenario and how the `find` mechanism behaves at each step.

#### Parsing user input

1. The user inputs the `find` command and provide the input with the attribute of the student contact and its respective prefix (eg. `n/NAME` or `p/PHONE`) in which the user wants to find the contact.

2. The `ArchDukeParser` then does preliminary processing to the user input and creates a new `FindCommandParser`.

3. The `FindCommandParser` then parses the user input and check whether all the input attributes are present by checking the presence of the prefixes.
   It also checks whether the command is in the correct format and ensures that there are no multiples of prefixes. In this case, the required prefix and attribute can be any of the `Person`'s attribute, such as  `n/NAME` or `a/ACADEMIC MAJOR`. <br> <br> At this stage, if none of the prefixes are present or the input contains multiple prefixes,
   `ParseException` would be thrown.

4. If the required prefix and attribute is present (i.e. `n/NAME`), `FindCommandParser` will then call the `ParserUtil#parseName()`
   to check for the validity of the input `NAME`. <br>
   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The `ParserUtil#parse` will follow the input of the prefix (e.g. If the prefix used is `p/` the `ParserUtil` will be `ParserUtil#parsePhone()` or `e/` then the `ParserUtil` will be `ParserUtil#parseEmail()`
   </div> 
   <br> At this stage, `ParseException` would be thrown if the
   `NAME` specified is invalid.

5. The `FindCommandParser` then creates the `FindCommand` based on the processed inputs.

#### Command execution

6. The `LogicManager` executes the `FindCommand`.
7. The `FindCommand` calls the `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the filtered person list based on the user input attributes.
8. The `FindCommand` then calls the `Model#getFilteredPersonList()#size()` to get the size of the person list. The size will correspond to the number of persons listed.

#### Displaying of result
9. Finally, the `FindCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with a success message and return it to the `LogicManager` to complete the command execution.
    The GUI would also be updated on this change in the person list and update the display of person list accordingly.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `find` command:

![](images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Design considerations

#### Aspect: How the find command finds the student contact 

* **Alternative 1**: finds student contact without any prefixes.
    * Pros: Allows the users to find student contact with ease without remembering any prefixes.
    * Cons: It is hard to determine which attributes the users are referring to. If there are multiple contacts which have similar attribute names, the `find` will not be able to pinpoint on the correct contact. For instance, Contact 1: `Name = Ben Science`, `Academic Major = Mathematics` and Contact 2: `Name = Alice Teo`, `Academic Major = Science`. If the user input `find Science`, the two contacts will be listed and hence the search efficiency is compromised.

* **Alternative 2**: finds through partial search (eg. `Dav` to find `David`)
    * Pros: Allows the users to save time as they are not required to input the full details.
    * Cons: In a situation when there are multiple contacts with similar names (i.e. `Ben`, `Benedict`, `Benny`), a partial search may not be really beneficial as the users would still require to input the almost to full name in order to get the desired person.

## \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
