### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete [p] 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `InterviewListPanel`, `TaskListPanel`,`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person`, `Interview`, `Task` objects residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `HelpCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an applicant).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete [p] 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete [p] 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* All `XYZTYPECommandParser` classes (`XYZ` refers to the specific command, and `TYPE` refers to either `Person`, `Task` or `Interview` objects e.g., `AddTaskCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) are created by the `XYZCommandParser` classes, which return an `XYZTYPECommand` (`XYZTYPECommand` referring to the specific command e.g. `AddPersonCommand`, `DeleteTaskCommand`, ...).
* `XYZCommand` like `AddCommand` and `DeleteCommand` are abstract classes, which inherits from the abstract `Command` class, so they may be treated similarly where possible. However `XYZCommand` like `HelpCommand` and `ExitCommand` are non-abstract classes but also inherits from abstract class Command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the HRConnect data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object), all `Interview` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueInterviewList` object), all `Task` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTaskList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Interview` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Interview>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Task` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below for `Person`, `Interview` and `Task` separately. <br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both HRConnect data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Export Feature

The export feature takes the current HRConnect data stored in memory and exports the job applicants data into a user-specified
csv file that is tab-delimited.

The structure for the csv file is defined as follows:

name | phone number | email | address | job position | stage

#### Implementation

The export feature is facilitated by the `ExportCommand` while the necessary checks for the export
feature is facilitated by the `ExportCommandParser`.

&nbsp;

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the export mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. User enters `export ./mydata.csv` into the application.

Step 2. The file path is passed to `ExportCommandParser#parse()` and `ExportCommandParser#checkFilePath()` checks the validity of the file path.

Step 3. After checking that the file path is valid, the data type of the file path is converted from its *string* representation into a *Path* representation.

Step 4. A new `ExportCommand` object is created with the file path as its parameter.

Step 5. The `ExportCommand#execute()` method is called, and it calls `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` to get the current list of job applicants.

Step 6. For each person in the persons list, the *string* representation of each field is obtained and concatenated into
the aformentioned format above, then it is written into the user-specified csv file.

Step 7. A new `CommandResult` object is returned signifying that the command has executed successfully.

&nbsp;

The following sequence diagram summarises how `export ./mydata.csv` works.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Interactions for Export Command"/>
</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Import Feature

The import feature takes in a csv file and adds all the job applicants stored in the csv file back into the HRConnect.

The csv file structure needs to follow the file structure as defined by the [export feature](#export-feature).

#### Implementation

The import feature is facilitated by the `ImportCommand` while the necessary checks for the import feature is facilitated by the `ImportCommandParser`.

&nbsp;

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the import mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. User enters `import ./mydata.csv` into the application.

Step 2. The file path is passed to `ImportCommandParser#parse()` and `ImportCommandParser#checkFilePath()` checks the validity of the file path.

Step 3. After checking that the file path is valid, the data type of the file path is converted from its *string* representation into a *Path* representation.

Step 4. The `ImportCommandParser#readCsv()` is called to parse the csv file. From there, 3 methods are called to ensure the correctness of the csv file.
 * `ImportCommandParser#getFields()`: ensures that the number of fields in each line matches the number of fields required by the application
 * `ImportCommandParser#createPerson()`: ensures that each field is valid and correct and converts the line into a person object.
 * `ImportCommandParser#updatePersons()`: ensures that each person in the csv file is unique with regards to the csv file.

Step 5. The newly created person is added to a temporary list.

Step 6. A new `ImportCommand` object is created with the aforementioned temporary list as its parameter.

Step 7. The `ImportCommand#execute()` method is called. It checks that there are no persons in the temporary list that already exists in the current HRConnect before adding each person into the current HRConnect.

Step 8. A new `CommandResult` object is returned signifying that the command has executed successfully.

&nbsp;

The following sequence diagram summarises how `import ./mydata.csv` works.

</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ImportCheckSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Interactions for Import checking Command"/>
</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find Feature

The find feature finds all data within a specified section (Person/Interview/Task) such that it matches the search criteria.

#### Implementation

The find feature is facilitated by the subclasses of the `FindCommand` while the necessary validity checks for the find feature is facilitated by the subclasses of `FindCommandParser`. The actual filtering is faciliated by the `{Section}ContainsKeywordsPredicate`

&nbsp;

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. User enters `find [t] g/i/update` into the application.

Step 2. The input is passed to `FindCommandParser#parse()` and its section is determined.

Step 3. Next, the input is parsed and checked for any invalid groups.

Step 4. The list of groups are then passed into `FindTaskCommandParser#parse()` to check for any invalid flags or formats.

Step 5. A new `TaskContainsKeywordsPredicate` predicate object is created using the list of groups as its parameter.

Step 6. A new `FindTaskCommand` object is created with the aforementioned predicate object as its parameter.

Step 7. The `FindTaskCommand#execute()` method is called. It filters the current HRConnect such that it satisfies the predicate object and displays it on the screen.

Step 8. A new `CommandResult` object is returned signifying that the command has executed successfully.


&nbsp;

The following sequence diagram summarises how `find [t] g/i/update` works

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Interactions for Find Task Command"/>
</p>

#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1:** Using AND, OR, NOT operators (i.e. `find john AND tom OR (gmail.com AND NOT 111)`).
  * Pros: More intuitive to the technically inclined and more control over the search results.
  * Cons: Harder to parse and implement.
* **Alternative 2** Using free text queries (i.e. `find john tom gmail.com`)
  * Pros: More intuitive as user expects queried person to contain all the search terms.
  * Cons: Lacks the flexibility provided by AND and OR operators.
