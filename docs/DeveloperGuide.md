TAPA (Teaching Assistant's Personal Assistant) is a desktop app that allows TAs to better manage their student’s progress,
especially for those who are teaching multiple classes/modules at the same time. It is optimised for use on a CLI.

TAPA's developer guide is written for developers who wish to contribute to our project. 
The developer guide will explain the technical aspects of the inner workings behind TAPA, and how the various components will come together.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a `Person`).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagrams below illustrate the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagramNew-1.png" width="1320" />

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagramNew-2.png)

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="691" />


The `Model` component,

* stores TAPA's data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both TAPA's data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Command

#### Description

The `add` command allows users to add a particular student into TAPA.
Since not all fields are compulsory during the execution of the `add` command,
the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`. After which, a new `AddCommand`
object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Implementation

1. Upon receiving the user input,
   the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "add", `AddCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called.
   In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word ("add").
4. In the `AddCommandParser#parse(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into an `ArgumentMultimap`,
   by using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes)`.

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
    <b>Note:</b> A `ParseException` will be thrown if the prefix of the compulsory fields are missing.
    </div> 

5. The `AddCommandParser` will pass the studentId input (found in the `ArgumentMultimap`)
   into `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   <b>Note:</b> A `NullPointerException` will be thrown if the supplied string argument is `null`.
    </div> 

6. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
7. `StudentId#isValidId(String studentId)` will then be invoked,
   which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied).
   If the argument is valid, a new `StudentId` object will be created and returned to the `AddCommandParser`.
   If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
8. Step 5 to 7 will be repeated for the other compulsory fields (`name`, `moduleCode`)
   and optional fields (`phone`, `telegramHandle`, `email`), by using their respective parse methods in `ParserUtil`.


   | Field          | Parse Methods                              |
   |----------------|--------------------------------------------|
   | Index          | parseIndex(String oneBasedIndex)           |
   | StudentId      | parseStudentId(String studentId)           |
   | Name           | parseName(String name)                     |
   | ModuleCode     | parseModuleCode(String moduleCode)         |
   | Phone          | parsePhone(String phone)                   |
   | TelegramHandle | parseTelegramHandle(String telegramHandle) |
   | Email          | parseEmail(String email)                   |
   | Task           | parseTask(String task)                     |

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   <b>Note:</b> If an optional field is not supplied (i.e. not found in the `ArgumentMultimap`), 
   the extra parsing process in steps 5 to 7 will be skipped.
   Instead, the respective object will be created and initialized to `null`.
    </div>

9. The `AddCommandParser` will create a new `Person`.
10. A new `AddCommand` will be created (using the `Person` in Step 9) and returned to the `LogicManager`.
11. The `LogicManager` will then call `AddCommand#execute(Model model)`.
12. In the `AddCommand`, the `model#hasPerson(Person person)` will be invoked. If the `Person` already exist
    in TAPA, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
    <b>Note:</b> In TAPA, two `Person` are considered as equal only if they have the same `studentId`.
    </div> 


13. The `AddCommand` will call `model.addPerson(Person person)`, which adds the `Person` into the `AddressBook`.
14. Lastly, the `AddCommand` will create a new `CommandResult`, which will be returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

<img src="images/AddCommandSequenceDiagram-2.png" width="849" />

### Delete Command

#### Description

The `delete` command allows users to delete particular students from TAPA.
Since not all fields are compulsory during the execution of the `delete` command,
the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`. After which, a new `DeleteCommand`
object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Implementation

1. Upon receiving the user input,
   the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "delete", `DeleteCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called.
   In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word ("delete").
4. In the `DeleteCommandParser#parse(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into an `ArgumentMultimap`,
   by using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes)`.

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
    <b>Note:</b> A `ParseException` will be thrown if the prefix of the compulsory fields are missing.
    </div> 

5. The `DeleteCommandParser` will pass the studentId input (found in the `ArgumentMultimap`)
   into `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   <b>Note:</b> A `NullPointerException` will be thrown if the supplied string argument is `null`.
    </div> 


6. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
7. `StudentId#isValidId(String studentId)` will then be invoked,
   which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied).
   If the argument is valid, a new `StudentId` object will be created and returned to the `DeleteCommandParser`.
   If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   <b>Note:</b> The above description for Steps 5 to 7 is specifically for when `studentId` is used as the input field.
   Depending on the type of input field used (`StudentId` or `Index`), Steps 5 to 7 will
   be executed using the parse methods in `ParserUtil` that are specific to the field. In the case of indices, an `Index` array is created in place of the `StudentId`.
    </div>

   | Field          | Parse Methods                              |
   |----------------|--------------------------------------------|
   | Index          | parseIndex(String oneBasedIndex)           |
   | StudentId      | parseStudentId(String studentId)           |
   | Name           | parseName(String name)                     |
   | ModuleCode     | parseModuleCode(String moduleCode)         |
   | Phone          | parsePhone(String phone)                   |
   | TelegramHandle | parseTelegramHandle(String telegramHandle) |
   | Email          | parseEmail(String email)                   |
   | Task           | parseTask(String task)                     |

8. A new `DeleteCommand` will be created (using the `StudentId` or `Index` array returned in Step 8) and returned to the `LogicManager`.
9. The `LogicManager` will then call `DeleteCommand#execute(Model model)`.
10. In the `DeleteCommand`, a new `StudentIdContainsKeywordsPredicate` is created if `StudentId` was used as the input.
11. If `StudentId` was used, the `model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)` will then be invoked, which
    updates the filter of the `PersonList` to filter by the given `StudentIdContainsKeywordsPredicate`, after which the entry (if any) that matches the `StudentIdContainsKeywordsPredicate` will be deleted by invoking `model#deletePerson(Person person)`.
12. Otherwise, if an `Index` array was used, a list of `Person`s corresponding to their `Index` in the displayed list will be created, after which they will be processed one by one for deletion.
13. Lastly, the `DeleteCommand` will create a new `CommandResult`, which will be returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works:

<img src="images/DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram-1.png" width="1330" />

![DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram-2](images/DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram-2.png)

### DeleteModule Command

#### Description

The `deleteModule` command allows users to delete all students of the inputted `ModuleCode` from TAPA.
During the execution of the `deleteModule` command, the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`.
After which, a new `DeleteModuleCommand` object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Implementation

1. Upon receiving the user input,
   the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "deleteModule", `DeleteModuleCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called.
   In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word ("deleteModule").
4. In the `DeleteModuleCommandParser#parse(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into an `ArgumentMultimap`,
   by using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes)`.
   
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
    <b>Note:</b> A `ParseException` will be thrown if the prefix of the compulsory field is missing.
    </div>

5. The `DeleteModuleCommandParser` will pass the moduleCode input (found in the `ArgumentMultimap`)
   into `ParserUtil#parseModuleCode(String moduleCode)`.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   <b>Note:</b> A `NullPointerException` will be thrown if the supplied string argument is `null`.
    </div> 


6. In `ParserUtil#parseModuleCode(String moduleCode)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
7. `ModuleCode#isValidModuleCode(String moduleCode)` will then be invoked,
   which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied).
   If the argument is valid, a new `ModuleCode` object will be created and returned to the `DeleteModuleCommandParser`.
   If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
8. The `DeleteModuleCommandParser` will create a new `ModuleCodeContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
9. A new `DeleteModuleCommand` will be created (using the `ModuleCodeContainsKeywordsPredicate` returned in Step 8) and returned to the `LogicManager`.
10. The `LogicManager` will then call `DeleteModuleCommand#execute(Model model)`.
11. The `model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)` will then be invoked, which
    updates the filter of the `PersonList` to filter by the given `ModuleIdContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
12. Each `Person` that appears in the filtered list will then be deleted by invoking `model#deletePerson(Person person)`.
13. Lastly, the `DeleteModuleCommand` will create a new `CommandResult`, which will be returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the deleteModule operation works:

<img src="images/DeleteModuleCommandSequenceDiagram-1.png" width="1771" />

![DeleteModuleCommandSequenceDiagram-2](images/DeleteModuleCommandSequenceDiagram-2.png)

### Find Command

#### Description

The `find` command allows users to find a particular student into TAPA.
Since not all fields are compulsory during the execution of the `find` command,
the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`. After which, a new `FindCommand`
object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Implementation

1. Upon receiving the user input,
   the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "find", `FindCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called.
   In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word ("find").
4. In the `FindCommandParser#parse(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into an `ArgumentMultimap`,
   by using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes)`.

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
    <b>Note:</b> A `ParseException` will be thrown if the prefix of the compulsory fields are missing.
    </div> 

5. The `FindCommandParser` will pass the studentId input (found in the `ArgumentMultimap`)
   into `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   <b>Note:</b> A `NullPointerException` will be thrown if the supplied string argument is `null`.
    </div> 

6. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
7. `StudentId#isValidId(String studentId)` will then be invoked,
   which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied).
   If the argument is valid, a new `StudentId` object will be created and returned to the `FindCommandParser`.
   If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   <b>Note:</b> The above description for Steps 5 to 7 is specifically for when `studentId` is used as the input field.
   Depending on the type of input field used (`studentId`, `name`, `moduleCode`), Steps 5 to 7 will 
   be executed using the parse methods in `ParserUtil` that are specific to the field.
    </div> 

   | Field          | Parse Methods                              |
      |----------------|--------------------------------------------|
   | Index          | parseIndex(String oneBasedIndex)           |
   | StudentId      | parseStudentId(String studentId)           |
   | Name           | parseName(String name)                     |
   | ModuleCode     | parseModuleCode(String moduleCode)         |
   | Phone          | parsePhone(String phone)                   |
   | TelegramHandle | parseTelegramHandle(String telegramHandle) |
   | Email          | parseEmail(String email)                   |
   | Task           | parseTask(String task)                     |

8. The `FindCommandParser` will create a new `Predicate`.
9. A new `FindCommand` will be created (using the `Predicate` in Step 8) and returned to the `LogicManager`.
10. The `LogicManager` will then call `FindCommand#execute(Model model)`.
11. In the `FindCommand`, the `model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)` will be invoked, which
    updates the filter of the `PersonList` to filter by the given `Predicate`.
12. Lastly, the `FindCommand` will create a new `CommandResult`, which will be returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

<img src="images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram-1.png" width="1477" />

![FindCommandSequenceDiagram-2](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram-2.png)

### Task Command

#### Description

The `task` command allows users to check and view all the tasks belonging to a particular student.
During the execution of the `task` command, the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`.
After which, a new `TaskCommand` object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the LogicManager.

#### Implementation

1. Upon receiving the user input,
   the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AdddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "task", `TaskCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called.
   In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word ("task").
4. In the `TaskCommandParser#parse(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into an `ArgumentMultimap`,
   by using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes)`.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   <b>Note:</b> A `ParseException` will be thrown if the prefix of `StudentId` is missing, as it is a compulsory field.
   </div>

5. The `TaskCommandParser` will pass the studentId input (found in the `ArgumentMultimap`)
   into `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   <b>Note:</b> A `NullPointerException` will be thrown if the supplied string argument is `null`.
   </div>

6. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
7. `StudentId#isValidId(String studentId)` will then be invoked,
   which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied).
   If the argument is valid, a new StudentId object will be created and returned to the `TaskCommandParser`.
   If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
8. A new `TaskCommand` will be created (using the `StudentId` object created in Step 7) and returned to the `LogicManager`.
9. The `LogicManager` will then call `TaskCommand#execute(Model model)`.
10. In the `TaskCommand`, a `StudentIdContainsKeywordsPredicate` is created using the studentId.
11. The `model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` is then invoked such that the list is filtered by the predicate created.
12. The `model#getFilteredPersonList()` is then called.
    The size of the resulting list determines if there is any `Person` that corresponds to the specified `studentId`.
    If the size is equals to 0, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
    <b>Note:</b> The `studentId` is a UNIQUE field in TAPA, so multiple students cannot have the same `studentId`.
    </div>

13. The `Person` object in the filtered list is then extracted out using `model#getFilteredPersonList().get(0)`.
14. The `TaskList` belong to this `Person` can then be retrieved using `Person#getTaskList()`.
15. If this `TaskList` is null or empty, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
16. The `TaskCommand` iterates through this `TaskList`, and categorises the tasks into two new `TaskList`
    according to the task's completion status.
17. Lastly, the `TaskCommand` will create a new `CommandResult` by using the `TaskList` in Step 16.
    This `CommandResult` will then be returned to `LogicManager`.

### Mark Command

#### Description

The `mark` command marks a specific undone task as done for a particular student. During the execution of the `mark` command, the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`. After which, a new `MarkCommand` object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Implementation
1. Upon receiving the user input, the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "mark", `MarkCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called. In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word "mark".
4. In the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into an `ArgumentMultiMap`, by `using ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes)`.
    
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    <b>Note:</b> A `ParseException` will be thrown if the prefix of the compulsory fields are missing or if the arguments are invalid.
    </div>

5. The `MarkCommandParser` will pass the studentId input (found in the `ArgumentMultiMap`) into `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`.
    
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    <b>Note:</b> A `NullPointerException` will be thrown if the supplied string argument is `null`.
    </div>

6. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
7. `StudentId#isValidId(String studentId)` will then be invoked, which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied). If the argument is valid, a new `StudentId` object will be created and returned to the `MarkCommandParser`. If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
8. The `MarkCommandParser` will pass the index input (found in the `ArgumentMultiMap`) into `ParserUtil#parseIndex(Index index)`.
    
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    <b>Note:</b> A `NullPointerException` will be thrown if the supplied string argument is null.
    </div>

9. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(Index index)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
10. `Index#isValidId(Index index)` will then be invoked, which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied). If the argument is valid, a new `Index` object will be created and returned to the `MarkCommandParser`. If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
11. The `MarkCommandParser` will create a new `MarkCommand` object using the `StudentId` and `Index` created in Step 7 and 10 respectively.
12. The `LogicManager` will then call `MarkCommand#execute(Model model)`.
13. The `MarkCommand` will call `model#markTaskOfPerson(Student studentId, Index index)`, which marks the task (corresponding to the supplied index) of the given student as done.
    
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    <b>Note:</b> A `CommandException` will be thrown if the supplied `index` or `studentId` is invalid, or if the task is already marked as completed.
    </div>
    
14. Lastly, the `MarkCommand` will create a new `CommandResult`, which will be returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagrams shows how the mark command works:

### Unmark Command

#### Description

The `unmark` command marks a specific done task as undone for a particular student. During the execution of the `unmark` command, the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`. After which, a new `UnmarkCommand` object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Implementation
1. Upon receiving the user input, the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "unmark", `UnmarkCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called. In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word "unmark".
4. In the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into an `ArgumentMultiMap`, by `using ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes)`.
    
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    <b>Note:</b> A `ParseException` will be thrown if the prefix of the compulsory fields are missing or if the arguments are invalid.
    </div>

5. The `UnmarkCommandParser` will pass the studentId input (found in the `ArgumentMultiMap`) into `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`.
    
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    <b>Note:</b> A `NullPointerException` will be thrown if the supplied string argument is `null`.
    </div>

6. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
7. `StudentId#isValidId(String studentId)` will then be invoked, which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied). If the argument is valid, a new `StudentId` object will be created and returned to the `UnmarkCommandParser`. If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
8. The `UnmarkCommandParser` will pass the index input (found in the `ArgumentMultiMap`) into `ParserUtil#parseIndex(Index index)`.
    
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    <b>Note:</b> A `NullPointerException` will be thrown if the supplied string argument is `null`.
    </div>

9. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(Index index)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
10. `Index#isValidId(Index index)` will then be invoked, which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied). If the argument is valid, a new `Index` object will be created and returned to the `UnmarkCommandParser`. If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
11. The `UnmarkCommandParser` will create a new `UnmarkCommand` object using the `StudentId` and `Index` created in Step 7 and 10 respectively.
12. The `LogicManager` will then call `UnmarkCommand#execute(Model model)`.
13. The `UnmarkCommand` will call `model#unmarkTaskOfPerson(Student studentId, Index index)`, which marks the task (corresponding to the supplied index) of the given student as undone.
    
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    <b>Note:</b> A `CommandException` will be thrown if the supplied `index` or `studentId` is invalid, or if the task is already marked as not complete.
    </div>

14. Lastly, the `UnmarkCommand` will create a new `CommandResult`, which will be returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagrams shows how the unmark command works:

### Clear Command

#### Description

The `clear` command deletes all students currently stored in TAPA. Before all the students are deleted, the user will have to confirm their decision by inputting "confirm".

#### Implementation
1. When the user inputs "clear", the `LogicManager` parses the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. A new `ClearCommand` is created by `AddressBookParser` and returned to the `LogicManager`.
3. The `LogicManager` calls `ClearCommand#execute(Model model)`, which returns a new `CommandResult` object (with its `isClearRequest` field set to `true`) to the `LogicManager`.
4. The `CommandResult` (with its `isClearRequest` field set to `true`) is then returned to the `MainWindow`.
5. To confirm the user's decision to clear TAPA, the `MainWindow` executes `MainWindow#handleClearRequest()` which updates the `CommandBox` to only recognise a "confirm" input for the next command.

   ![ClearCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
   
   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
   <b>Note:</b> A `CommandException` will be thrown if the user inputs anything other than "confirm" for the next input. The `CommandBox` will then return to its normal operation, accepting all commands as described in the user guide.
   </div>
   
   ![ClearCommandActivityDiagram](images/ClearCommandActivityDiagram.png)

6. If the user inputs "confirm", the `LogicManager` parses the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, then a new `ConfirmClearCommand` is created and returned to the `LogicManager`.
7. The `LogicManager` will then call `ConfirmClearCommand#execute(Model model)`.
8. The `ConfirmClearCommand` calls `Model#setAddressBook(new AddressBook())` which resets the current list of students stored in TAPA to an empty list.
9. Lastly, the `ConfirmClearCommand` creates a new `CommandResult`, which is returned to the `LogicManager`.

![ConfirmClearCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ConfirmClearCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How TAPA confirms the user's decision to clear TAPA**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have the user input "confirm", which is treated by TAPA as a command being executed.
   * Pros: Easy to implement and test. Having the user type "confirm" is an added safety measure to ensure the user does not clear TAPA accidentally.
   * Cons: The user would take a longer time to clear TAPA than if a "confirm" button is implemented.

* **Alternative 2:** Have a pop-up window with a "confirm" button which the user can click to confirm or cancel their decision.
   * Pros: Faster to click a button than having to type "confirm" to clear TAPA.
   * Cons: More difficult to implement and test as it involves extending the UI.

### Archive Command

#### Description

The `archive` command allows users to save the current state of the data in TAPA,
into a separate `.json` file. This newly created file can be found in the same
folder as the original data file (in `/data`). In addition, it will have a file name
that corresponds to the date and time (up to 6 significant figures) in which the
command is being called. This ensures that files created will have a unique file name
in most cases.

#### Implementation

1. Upon receiving the user input,
   the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "archive", `ArchiveCommand()` will be called.
4. As `ArchiveCommand` utilizes the default constructor, it simply returns a new `ArchiveCommand` object to
   the `AddressBookParser`.
5. This `ArchiveCommand` object will then be subsequently returned to the `LogicManager`.
6. The `LogicManager` calls `ArchiveCommand#execute(Model model)`.
7. In `ArchiveCommand`, the `Path` to the existing `AddressBook` is extracted, 
   by calling `model#getAddressBookFilePath()`.
8. Similarly, the existing `AddressBook` is also extracted, by calling `model#getAddressBook()`.
9. With the help of the `DateTimeFormatter` and `LocalDateTime` in the Java 8 Date Time API, 
   the file name and path of the new `.json` data file can be obtained.
10. The new `.json` data file can now be created, using `FileUtil.createIfMissing(newPath)`.
    A `CommandException` will be thrown if `ArchiveCommand` fails to create this file.
11. The current copy of the `AddressBook` can be "copied" into a new `JsonSerializableAddressBook`,
    which will be used to populate the new `.json` data file that was created 
    (by utilizing `JsonUtil#saveJsonFile(T JsonFile, Path path)`).
    A `CommandException` will be thrown if `ArchiveCommand` fails to populate the data file.
12. Lastly, the `ArchiveCommand` will create a new `CommandResult`, which will then be returned to `LogicManager`.

### Assign Command

#### Description

The `assign` command allows users to assign tasks to student.
During the execution of the `assign` command, the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`.
After which, a new `AssignCommand` object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the LogicManager.

#### Implementation

1. Upon receiving the user input,
   the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AdddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "assign", `AssignCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called.
   In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word ("assign").
4. In the `AssignCommandParser#parse(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into an `ArgumentMultimap`,
   by using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefex... prefixes)`.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    <b>Note:</b> A `ParseException` will be thrown if the prefix of `Task` is missing, or if either the prefix of `StudentId` or `ModuleCode` is missing, as they are compulsory fields.
   </div> 

5. The `AssignCommandParser` will pass the studentId input (found in the `ArgumentMultimap`)
   into `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
   <b>Note:</b> A `NullPointerException` will be thrown if the supplied string argument is `null`.
   </div> 

6. In `ParserUtil#parseStudentId(String studentId)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
7. `StudentId#isValidId(String studentId)` will then be invoked,
   which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied).
   If the argument is valid, a new StudentId object will be created and returned to the `AssignCommandParser`.
   If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
   <b>Note:</b> The above description for Steps 5 to 7 is specifically for when `studentId` is used as the input field.
   In the case of `moduleCode`, the `Module` prefix will be used to tokenize the input.
   Depending on the type of input field used (`studentId` or `moduleCode`), Steps 5 to 7 will be executed using the parse 
   methods in `ParserUtil` that are specific to the field. The argument's validity would be checked in their respective classes as well.
    </div>

8. The `AssignCommandParser` will pass the task input (found in the `ArgumentMultimap`)
   into `ParserUtil#parseTask(String task)`.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
   <b>Note:</b> A `NullPointerException` will be thrown if the supplied string argument is `null`.
   </div>

9. In `ParserUtil#parseTask(String task)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
10. `Task#isValidTaskName(String task)` will then be invoked,
    which checks if the trimmed argument is valid (according to the Regex supplied).
    If the argument is valid, a new Task object will be created and returned to the `AssignCommandParser`.
    If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.

11. A new `AssignCommand` will be created (using the `StudentId` or `ModuleCode` object and `Task` object created) and returned to the `LogicManager`.

12. The `LogicManager` will then call `AssignCommand#execute(Model model)`.

13. If `StudentId` is used, `AssignCommand#assignTaskToPerson(StudentId studentId, Task task)` method will be invoked,
    which will in turn invoke `model#assignTaskToPerson(StudentId studentId, Task task)` method and
    `AddressBook#assignTaskToPerson(StudentId studentId, Task task)` method. If `ModuleCode` is used,
    `AssignCommand#assignTaskToAllInModule(ModuleCode moduleCode, Task task)` method will be invoked, which will in
    turn invoke `model#assignTaskToAllInModule(ModuleCode moduleCode, Task task)` method and
    `AddressBook#assignTaskToAllInModule(ModuleCode moduleCode, Task task)` method.

14. If `StudentId` is used, `UniquePersonList#assignTaskToPerson(StudentId studentId, Task task)` method is called.
    If `ModuleCode` is used, `UniquePersonList#assignTaskToAllInModule(ModuleCode moduleCoded, Task task)` is called.
    This will iterate through each `Person` object and check for matching `studentId` or `moduleCode`.

      <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
      <b>Note:</b> 
      If no student(s) with a matching `studentId` or `moduleCode` is found, then `PersonNotFoundException` or `ModuleCodeNotFoundException` will be thrown.
      </div>

15. If a `Student` object with matching `studentId` or `moduleCode` is found the method uses `Person#isTaskAlreadyPresent(Task task)`
    method to check if the `task` is assigned.
    If no similar `task` is found, the following step will take place.

      <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
      <b>Note:</b>
      If all the student(s) has already been assigned that task, then `DuplicateTaskException` will be thrown. 
      If some, not all students in the `moduleCode` has already been assigned that task, then `PartialDuplicateTaskException` will be thrown.
      </div>

16. The method gets copy of the `Student` object by invoking `Person#getCopy()` method. The copy is updated to include `task` by invoking `Person#addTask(Task task)`.
17. `Person#addTask(Task task)` method will invoke `TaskList#addTask(Task task)`, which adds the task to a list of assigned tasks.
18. The `model#updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)` is then invoked such that the list is filtered by the predicate created. In this case all the students will be in the filtered list.
19. Lastly, the `AssignCommand` will create a new `CommandResult`, which will be returned to `LogicManager`.

### Progress Command

#### Description

The `progress` command allows users to view the completion status of all students who are taking a particular
module and are assigned to a particular task.
During the execution of the `progress` command, the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`.
After which, a new `ProgressCommand` object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Implementation

1. Upon receiving the user input,
   the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "progress", 
   `ProgressCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called.
   In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word ("progress").
4. In the `ProgressCommandParser#parse(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into an `ArgumentMultimap`,
   by using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes)`.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
      <b>Note:</b> A `ParseException` will be thrown if the prefix of the compulsory fields are missing.
   </div>

5. The `ProgressCommandParser` will pass the moduleCode input (found in the `ArgumentMultimap`)
   into `ParserUtil#parseModuleCode(String moduleCode)`.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
     <b>Note:</b> A `NullPointerException` will be thrown if the supplied string argument is `null`.
   </div>

6. In `ParserUtil#parseModuleCode(String moduleCode)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
7. `ModuleCode#isValidModuleCode(String moduleCode)` will then be invoked, which checks if the trimmed argument is
   valid (according to the Regex supplied).
   If the argument is valid, a new `ModuleCode` object will be created and returned to the `ProgressCommandParser`.
   If the argument is invalid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
8. Steps 5 to 7 will be repeated for the "task name" field, by using its respective parse methods in `ParserUtil`.
9. A new `ProgressCommand` will be created (using the parsed `ModuleCode` and `Task` objects) 
   and returned to the `LogicManager`.
10. The `LogicManager` will then call `ProgressCommand#execute(Model model)`.
11. In the `ProgressCommand`, the `model#checkProgress(ModuleCode moduleCode, Task task)` will be invoked.
    This method iterates through each `Person` object. If the `Person` has the same `ModuleCode` and `Task`
    assigned to him/her, the `Person` object and the completion status 
    (either completed/incomplete, denoted by a boolean value) will be added to a `LinkedHashMap<Person, boolean>`.
12. If the resulting `LinkedHashMap` is null or empty, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
13. This `LinkedHashMap` will be used to generate the output string.
14. The output string will be used in creating a new `CommandResult` object.
15. Lastly, the `CommandResult` object will be returned to `LogicManager`.

### DeleteTask Command

#### Description

The `deleteTask` command allows users to delete to task that was previously assigned to students.
During the execution of the `deleteTask` command, the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`.
After which, a new `deleteTaskCommand` object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the LogicManager.

#### Implementation

1. Upon receiving the user input,
   the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "deleteTask", `DeleteTaskCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called.
   In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word ("deleteTask").
4. In the `DeleteTaskCommandParser#parse(arguments)`, the arguments will be tokenized into an `ArgumentMultimap`,
   by using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes)`.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:

   If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.

   iv. The `moduleCodeOrTaskNameGiven` method will pass the taskName input (found in the `ArgumentMultimap`) into
   `ParserUtil#parseTask(String task)`.

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
       <b>Note:</b> A `NullPointerException` will be thrown if the supplied string argument is `null`.
    </div>

   v. In `ParserUtil#parseTask(String task)`, the supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.

   If the argument is valid, a new `Task` object will be created and returned to the `DeleteTaskCommandParser`.
   If the argument is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.

   vii. A new `DeleteTaskCommand(ModuleCode moduleCode, Task task)` will be created (using the `ModuleCode` and `Task` object created in Step 3 and 6) and returned to the `LogicManager`.

7. The `LogicManager` will then call `DeleteTaskCommand#execute(Model model)`.
8. If the both the `studentId` and `index` is present then `model#deleteTaskOfPerson(StudentId studentId, Index index)` method is invoked.

   i. `AddressBook#deleteTaskOfPerson(StudentId studentId, Index index)`is invoked, which invokes `UniquePersonList#deleteTaskOfPerson(StudentId studentId, Index index)` method.

   ii. This method will iterate through each `Person` object in and check for matching `studentId`.
   If found, the method will get a copy of the `Person` object by invoking `Person#getCopy()`, deletes the task by invoking `Person#deleteTask(Index index)`.
   If the index is out of bounds, `InvalidTaskIndexException()` will be thrown by the `taskList#deleteTask(Index index)` method.
   If no student with matching studentId is found, `PersonNotFoundException()` will be thrown.

   iii. The updated `Person` will be replaced the current `Person` object.

   iv. If the task is successfully deleted, the `model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)` will then be invoked by `model#deleteTaskOfPerson(StudentId studentId, Index index)` method, which
   updates the filter of the `PersonList` to filter by the given `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS`.

9. If the both the `moduleCode` and `task` is present then `model#deleteTaskForAllInModule(ModuleCode moduleCode, Task task)` method is invoked.

   i. `AddressBook#deleteTaskForAllInModule(ModuleCode moduleCode, Task task)`is invoked, which invokes `UniquePersonList#deleteTaskForAllInModule(ModuleCode moduleCode, Task task)` method.

   ii. This method will iterate through each `Person` object in and check for matching `moduleCode`.
   If found, the method will get a copy of the `Person` object by invoking `Person#getCopy()`, deletes the task by invoking `Person#deleteTask(Task task)`.
   If no task is found, `TaskNotFoundException()` will be thrown by the `taskList#deleteTask(Task task)` method.
   If no student with matching moduleCode is found, `ModuleCodeNotFoundException()` will be thrown.

   iii. The updated `Person` will be replaced the current `Person` object.

   iv. If the task is successfully deleted, the `model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)` will then be invoked by `model#deleteTaskForAllInModule(ModuleCode moduleCode, Task task)` method, which
   updates the filter of the `PersonList` to filter by the given `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS`.

10. Lastly, the `DeleteTaskCommand` will create a new `CommandResult` which `CommandResult` will be returned to `LogicManager`.

### History Command

#### Description

The `history` command displays a list of the user's previously executed commands. It is facilitated by `CommandHistory`, which stores the list of commands.

![CommandHistoryClassDiagram](images/CommandHistoryClassDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
<b>Note:</b> The :arrow_up_small: Up and :arrow_down_small: Down keyboard arrow keys can also be used to browse through the user's previously executed commands. This functionality is also facilitated by `CommandHistory`.
</div>

#### Implementation

1. When the user launches the application, `ModelManager` is initialised with a new `CommandHistory` object.
2. Whenever the user successfully executes a command, the `LogicManager` calls `Model#addToCommandHistory()`. This adds the command to the list of previously executed commands in `CommandHistory`.

   ![AddToCommandHistorySequenceDiagram](images/AddToCommandHistorySequenceDiagram.png)

3. When the user inputs "history", the `LogicManager` parses the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
4. A new `HistoryCommand` is created by `AddressBookParser` and returned to the `LogicManager`. 
5. The `LogicManager` will then call `HistoryCommand#execute(Model model)`. 
6. Following this, the `HistoryCommand` calls `Model#getCommandHistory()` to retrieve the list of previously executed commands. 
7. The `HistoryCommand` then calls `CommandHistory#display()` to convert the list to a `String` which is returned to `LogicManager` through a new `CommandResult`.

### Undo Command

#### Description

The `undo` command reverts the most recently executed command by restoring TAPA to its previous state before the last command was executed. It is facilitated by `AddressBookHistory` which saves all the details in TAPA as each command is executed during the current user session.

![AddressBookHistoryClassDiagram](images/AddressBookHistoryClassDiagram.png)

#### Implementation

1. When the user launches the application, `ModelManager` is initialised with a new `AddressBookHistory` object.
2. Whenever the user successfully executes a command (excluding `clear` and `undo` itself), the `LogicManager` calls `Model#saveCurrentAddressBookToHistory()`. This adds a copy of TAPA to the list of TAPA’s previous states in `AddressBookHistory`.

   ![AddToAddressBookHistorySequenceDiagram](images/AddToAddressBookHistorySequenceDiagram.png)

3. When the user inputs "undo", the `LogicManager` parses the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
4. A new `UndoCommand` is created by `AddressBookParser` and returned to the `LogicManager`.
5. The `LogicManager` will then call `UndoCommand#execute(Model model)`.
6. Following this, the `UndoCommand` calls `Model#undoAddressBook()` to revert the current details stored in TAPA to those stored before the previous command was executed. (Within `ModelManager`, `AddressBookHistory#getPreviousAddressBook` is called to retrieve the state of TAPA before the previous command.)
7. Lastly, the `UndoCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` which is returned to the `LogicManager`.

![UndoCommandSequenceDiagram](images/UndoCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How the `UndoCommand` reverts the changes made by the previous command**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the details of TAPA after each successfully executed command, then recover them when `undo` is executed.
   * Pros: Easy to implement and test.
   * Cons: Will take up more memory with each command executed.

* **Alternative 2:** Extend each command to be able to revert the changes it has made to TAPA.
   * Pros: Will not incur major performance issues as it uses less memory.
   * Cons: More difficult to implement and test. Each command would need a unique implementation to be undone, and this would also need to be implemented for commands added in the future.

### Sort Command

#### Description

The `sort` command allows the users to view the list of students in TAPA, sorted by the number of incomplete tasks in **descending** order.
During the execution of the `sort` command, the user's input is being parsed in `AddressBookParser`.
After which, a new `SortCommand` object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Implementation

1. Upon receiving the user input,
   the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "sort", `SortCommand()` will be called.
4. As `SortCommand` utilizes the default constructor, it simply returns a new `SortCommand` object to
   the `AddressBookParser`.
5. This `SortCommand` object will then be subsequently returned to the `LogicManager`.
6. The `LogicManager` calls `SortCommand#execute(Model model)`.
7. In `SortCommand`, the current list of students in TAPA will be sorted by the number of incomplete tasks in **descending** order by calling `model#sortFilteredPersonListByTaskLeft()`.
8. In `SortCommand`, the current list of students in TAPA will be updated to reflect the changes to the list, after the sort by calling `model#updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)`.
9. Lastly, the `SortCommand` will create a new `CommandResult`, which will then be returned to `LogicManager`.

### Manual Command

#### Description

The `manual` command displays the format and a short description for a particular command. During the execution of the `manual` command, the user's input is being parsed in `ManualCommandParser`. After which, a new `ManualCommand` object will be created, and is subsequently executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Implementation
1. Upon receiving the user input, the `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. Since the first word in the user input matches the word "manual", `ManualCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called. In this case, the arguments refer to the remaining input text after the exclusion of the command word "manual".

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
    <b>Note:</b> A `ParseException` will be thrown if the argument is invalid.
    </div>

4. The supplied argument will be trimmed using `String#trim()`.
5. The `ManualCommandParser` will create a new `ManualCommand` (using the `argument` in Step 4), which will be returned to `LogicManager`.
6. The `LogicManager` will call `ManualCommand#execute(Model model)`. If the `argument` is invalid, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
7. Lastly, the `ManualCommand` will create a new `CommandResult` which will be returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the manual command works:

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile** <br>
Teaching Assistants who:
* Need to manage a significant number of students (especially across multiple modules)
* Prefer desktop apps over other platforms
* Can type fast
* Prefer typing to mouse interactions
* Are reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition** <br>
TAPA will allow TAs to better manage their student’s contact and progress,
especially for TAs who are teaching multiple classes/modules at the same time.
It is optimised for use on CLI, and allows for more efficient student detail management for TAs who can type fast.
