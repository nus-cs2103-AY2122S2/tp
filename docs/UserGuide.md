<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
  
* The `|` symbol represents or. <br>
  e.g `list [flag|unflag]` means valid commands are `list flag` and `list unflag`

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected **only once** in the command but if you specified it multiple times, **only the last occurrence** of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `undo`, `redo`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `clear 123`, it will be interpreted as `clear`.

Outcome of `meet John Doe c/`:

![example Meet Command](images/exampleMeetCommandCancel.png)

## Viewing your clients and meetings

### Sorting all clients : `sort`

It then sorts all clients in HustleBook based on the parameter provided.
