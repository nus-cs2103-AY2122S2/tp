IBook is an inventory organizing system specially designed to manage products in a store.

<h2>Target User</h2>

IBook's target users are small-scale grocery storekeepers who are having issues with product organization and keeping track of expiring items.

We aim to help these storekeepers by

1. Simplifying the process of inventory organization.
2. Minimizing groceries wastage due to unnoticed expiring of items.

#### 2.3 Sections of the Application Window

The application window is divided into a Command Box, Result Window as well as a Display Table that includes all the products.

![UI-2](images/Ui-2.png)


The main mode of navigation in iBook is through the Command-line Interface (CLI).

You can type in commands into the command box and press enter on your keyboard to execute them.

Alternatively, you can interact with the application through buttons, such as the <img align="center" src = "images/ui-icons/add-product.png" alt="Add Product" height = "25"/> button.

Either way, the result window will display the results of executing the command. The display table will update accordingly based on the executed command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 2.4 Feature Format

Each command will be described in the following format.

<div class="feature">
  <h4>x.x.x Do something: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xxx-command</code></h4>
  <p>Do something very important</p>
  <p>Format : <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xxx-command XXX YYY [AAA] [BBB]</code></p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>

        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xxx-command XXX YYY</code></li>
  </ul>
  <h5>GUI alternative</h5>
  <p>...</p>
</div>

Although iBook is a CLI based application, we do provide a GUI alternative for some of the commonly used commands.

If a command has a GUI alternative, the subheading GUI alternative will be included in the same section.

You can interact with the application through buttons, such as the <img align="center" src="images/ui-icons/add-product.png" alt="Add Product" height="25"/> button.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Product and Item:**

As most of the commands revolve around products and items. We advise you to take a look at the [Glossary](#6-glossary) section for our definition of products and items before proceeding.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 2.5 Command Format


* **Words in `UPPER_CASE` are additional user inputs supplied to a command.**<br><br>
  e.g. In the `add n:NAME` command, `NAME` is an input that can be supplied as `add n:Maggie Mee`.

* **Inputs in square brackets are optional.**<br><br>
  e.g. If the command specifies `n:NAME [c:CATEGORY]`, both `n:Maggie Mee c:noodle` and `n:Maggie Mee` are acceptable.

* **Inputs separated by a vertical bar (`|`) inside brackets denote that either one of them can be provided, *but not both*.**<br><br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `[p:PRICE | sp:START_PRICE ep:END_PRICE]`, then an empty input, `p:2.00`, and `sp:1.00 ep:5.00` are all acceptable. However, `p:2.00 sp:1.00 ep:5.00` is not accepted.

* **Inputs of a command can be in any order.**<br><br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n:NAME c:CATEGORY`, `c:CATEGORY n:NAME` is also acceptable.

* **Extra inputs for commands that do not take in any (such as `exit`, `list`, `expired`, `out-of-stock`) will be ignored.**<br><br>
  e.g. the command `exit 123` will be interpreted as `exit`.

* **If two inputs of the same tag are given, the latter will be taken.**<br><br>
  e.g. the command `add n:Maggie Curry n:Maggie Chicken p:3.00 p:3.50` will add a product with the name `Maggie Chicken` and with a price of `3.50`.


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:exclamation: Important notes about inputs:**<br>

Inputs containing a colon (`:`) might cause unexpected behaviour. You are strongly recommended to add a backslash (`\`) before a colon character in your input.<br><br>
e.g. To provide a product name of `Nescafe: special edition`, you should type `n:Nescafe\: special edition`.

## 4. Storage

### 4.1 Saving the data

iBook's data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### 4.2 Editing the data file

iBook's data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/ibook.json` and `[JAR file location]/preferences.json`.

* `[JAR file location]/data/ibook.json` stores data related to `product` and `item`.
* `[JAR file location]/preferences.json` stores data related to the position and the size of the iBook.

Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation:

If your changes to the data file make it invalid, iBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file on the next run.

</div>

## 5. FAQ

**Q**: Why can't I open iBook with a double-click on macOS?<br>
**A**: You might be having an issue with untrusted developers, please type `java -jar ibook.jar` in a terminal to start the application.

**Q**: Why can't I find the data and preferences file when I open the application in macOS?<br>
**A**: This is a bug related to the macOS default `JavaLauncher`. The issue will occur when you use double-click to start iBook. To fix this problem, please type `java -jar ibook.jar` in a terminal to start the application.

**Q**: Can I use iBook with full-screen mode in macOS?<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, due to a limitation of the GUI library, iBook does not perform well with full-screen mode in macOS. Nevertheless, you can work around this issue by double-clicking on the title bar. IBook will then automatically resize to fill the screen.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous iBook home folder.
