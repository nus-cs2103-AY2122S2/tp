# Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `amigos.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.1).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your application.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g:

   * **`showfriends`** : Lists all friends.
   
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addfriend n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addfriend n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `showfriends`, `showevents` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `showfriends 123`, it will be interpreted as `showfriends`.
