<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
  
* The `|` symbol represents or. <br>
  e.g `list [flag|unflag]` means valid commands are `list flag` and `list unflag`

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected **only once** in the command but if you specified it multiple times, **only the last occurrence** of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `undo`, `redo`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `clear 123`, it will be interpreted as `clear`.

## Managing your meetings

### Scheduling / Rescheduling a meeting: `meet`

Schedules a meeting for the client with the specified `NAME` with the `DATE` and `TIME` of the meeting specified.
The same command can be used to reschedule a meeting with the client.

Format: `meet NAME d/DATE t/TIME`

* `DATE` input must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

Example:
* `meet John Doe d/2022-03-12 t/1430` Schedules a meeting with client named `John Doe` at 12 March 2022, 2:30pm.

Example:
* `meet John Doe c/` Cancels the meeting with client name `John Doe`.

Outcome of `meet John Doe c/`:

![example Meet Command](images/exampleMeetCommandCancel.png)

## Viewing your clients and meetings

### Sorting all clients : `sort`

It then sorts all clients in HustleBook based on the parameter provided.

:information_source: **Note:**
* `sort meeting` sorts clients by the date and time of the meeting. The earliest upcoming meeting will be displayed first.

* Names of clients should be separated by commas
  * Example: `find alex, david li` will match clients whose name contain `Alex` or `David Li`
