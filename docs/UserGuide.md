Tracey is a **desktop app for managing health statuses of NUS Hall Residents, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast,
Tracey can get your student health status management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

##  Brief Introduction

What are CLIs? What are GUIs?

CLIs are Command Line Interfaces. CLIs connect you to a computer program and through the CLI, you can interact with the application by typing in texts (commands).

GUIs are Graphical User Interfaces. GUIs are a system of interactive visual components for computer applications. You can interact with a GUI through a pointing device, such as your mouse.

Note that the main difference between GUI and CLI is the method of interaction.

As Tracey is a Command Line Interface, these are the aspects that highlight the power of Tracey and why it was developed using a CLI:

1. **Speed** <br>
   Tracey offers immense response speed. GUIs require additional resources to render graphical components, making them slower than CLIs.
2. **Functionality** <br>
   Tracey offers flexibility in its use. A typical GUI does not have the same level of functionality and granular control as a typical CLI. This is portrayed in the variety of features that Tracey offers, which you can learn about more in this User Guide.
3. **Scalability** <br>
   Simple command functions in Tracey allows it to handle various complex features. Additionally, the CLI of Tracey allows easier integration of newer features that may be added in future iterations, compared to GUIs which require rendering and creation of graphical components.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzl7e9JGag) illustrates the power of using CLI over GUI in performing the same task. <br>
(The video is produced by the developers of the FAST app, and has been approved for reuse.)

We hope you enjoy Tracey as much as we did when developing it!

## 2. Quick Start
Step 1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer. <br>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:**<br>

1. If you are unsure of which version of Java you are on, follow these steps. Otherwise, continue on from step 2.<br>

   To check your java version:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. For Mac users, open up Terminal and type in `java --version`.<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. For Windows users, open up Command Prompt and type in `java --version`.<br>

   2. If you have the supported version of Java, the response should resemble something like this `java 11.0.9 2020-10-20 LTS`.<br>

   3. If you do not see the supported version of Java, download Java from this [page](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

</div>

Step 2. Download the latest **Tracey.jar** from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/releases).<br>
Step 3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Tracey application.<br>
Step 4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI, similar to the one below, should appear in a few seconds.<br>
   Note how the app contains some sample data: <br>
   ![Ui](images/UiScreenshot.png) *Figure 1: Screenshot showing sample data.*
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:**<br>

1. If you are a Mac user and are unable to open the JAR file after double-clicking, please open Terminal and change directory to where **Tracey.jar** is located. Then, type the following command to open the application: `java -jar Tracey.jar`.<br>

2. If you are a Windows user and are unable to open the JAR file after double-clicking, please open Command Prompt and change directory to where **Tracey.jar** is located. Then, type the following command to open the application: `java -jar Tracey.jar`.
 
</div>
Step 5. Type your commands in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

* **`list`** : Lists all contacts.

* **`summarise`** : Summarises all contacts into their respective faculty and informs you the percentage of student from that block and/or faculty is Covid positive.

* **`add n/John Doe b/E f/SoC p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 mc/A0253647C cs/NEGATIVE t/leader`** : Adds a student named `John Doe` to Tracey.

* **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

* **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts.

* **`exit`** : Exits the app.

Step 6. Refer to the [Features](#3-features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Features
### 3.1. Viewing help: Need help finding the commands?
Don't worry, you can type `help` to search for all the commands that Tracey offers by opening a pop-up window.
It includes a summary to briefly explain all the commands.
The pop-up window also offers a button for easy access to the User Guide via your default browser.

Format: `help`

This is a sample screenshot of what you can expect from the `help` command.

![help](images/HelpScreenshot.png) *Figure 2: Screenshot of help command.*

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:**<br>

1. You can also use the `F1` key to open the pop-up window.

</div>

### 3.2. Adding a contact: Do you want to add a student? 
You can do this with the add feature which allows you to add a student with relevant details such as faculty and Covid status into Tracey.

Format: `add n/NAME b/BLOCK f/FACULTY p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS mc/MATRICULATION_NUMBER cs/COVID_STATUS t/TAGS...`

* Adds a student with the specified details.
* Tags are optional. You can add as many tags as you like.
    * Duplicate tags will be displayed as a single tag.
* The student name is case-sensitive e.g. `add n/johnDoe` will be logged as `johnDoe` and not `JohnDoe` in Tracey.
* Phone Number, email and matriculation number must be **unique** to each student.
* Order of the tags does not matter e.g. `add n/NAME p/PHONENUMBER` is the same as `add p/PHONENUMBER n/NAME`.
* Tracey will acknowledge that the student has been added.
* Values for faculty, Covid status and block need to be of a pre-defined constant as shown in the table below (refer to Table 4 below or in the [glossary](#6-glossary)).
* If any values for faculty, Covid status and block is not one of those defined in the **Pre-defined constants** as described in Table 4, there will be an error. You will have to input the details for the keyword again.
* If you added duplicate `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `f/`, `mc/`, `cs/` or `b/` prefixes, Tracey will record the latest of the duplicates. <br>
  i.e. `add e/student69@u.nus.edu n/Martin b/e f/fol e/martiniser@gmail.com p/98090042 a/74 Pasir Ris Avenue mc/a1223213h cs/positive` is the same as `add n/Martin b/e f/fol e/martiniser@gmail.com p/98090042 a/74 Pasir Ris Avenue mc/a1223213h cs/positive`.

Examples of usage:
* `add n/Melvin b/c f/SOC p/84440808 e/melvin@nus.edu.sg a/12 Kent Ridge Drive mc/a0211343z cs/Negative`
* `add n/Martin b/e f/fol e/martiniser@gmail.com p/98090042 a/74 Pasir Ris Avenue mc/a1223213h cs/positive t/level2`

*Table 4: Table showing list of possible prefixes and the Pre-defined constants.*

As described in Table 4, these are the possible prefixes that can be used with Tracey. E.g `n/`, `cs/` etc.
In addition, the list of pre-defined constants are also provided for `Faculty`, `Covid Status`, and `Block`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:**<br>

1. You are able to add optional tags with no restrictions using the `t/` prefix.<br>
2. Additions can be reversed with the `undo` feature (section 3.5).

</div>

### 3.3. Editing an existing contact: Student's information changed?  
You can change the information of a particular student with the `edit` feature.

Format: `edit INDEX n/NAME ...`
* Edits an existing student's information found in Tracey. The student is referred to by an index, displayed beside his/her name in the student list.
* To edit a student's details, you can use the command `edit` with the student's `INDEX` and the corresponding field prefix (mentioned in Figure 3 above).
  The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶
* The correct prefixes must be used in order for Tracey to know what you intend to edit.
* Refer to Table 4 in the [glossary](#6-glossary) for the correct format and pre-defined constants to be used for each input field.
* Existing information of the student will be replaced with the newly inputted values.
* When editing tags, all existing tags will be replaced with the newly inputted tag(s). <br>
  i.e. Adding tags is not cumulative. All new tags will replace all old tags.
* You can remove all tags of the student by typing `t/` without specifying any details after it.
* If you have included duplicate `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `f/`, `mc/`, `cs/` or `b/` prefixes, Tracey will record the latest of the duplicates. <br>
  i.e. `edit 1 p/98090042 p/81812424` is the same as `edit 1 p/81812424`.

How to identify `INDEX`:
![FAQ_IndexLocation](images/FAQ_IndexLocation.png) *Figure 3: Screenshot of index location.*

Examples of usage:
* `edit 2 n/David Limpeh t/` edits the entry to become `David Limpeh` and clears all existing tags.
* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email address of the 1st student to be `91234567`
  and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

Original list:
![Before_Edit](images/BeforeEdit.png) *Figure 4: Screenshot of Tracey before edit command is applied.*

Result of applying `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com`:
![After_Edit](images/AfterEdit.png) *Figure 5: Screenshot of Tracey after applying the edit command.*

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:**<br>

1. Tracey shows the entire edited student list after the edit command is applied.<br>

2. After every edit command, the student at the specified index will be shifted to the bottom of the list.<br>

3. If the input phone number, matriculation number, or email address is already in the address book, Tracey will show an error message saying "This person already exists in the address book."

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**<br>

1. Edits can be reversed with the `undo` feature (section 3.5).

</div>

### 3.4. Deleting a contact: Removing a student from the list?
You can remove a particular student in the list with the `delete` feature.

Format: `delete INDEX`
* Deletes an existing student in Tracey. The student is referred to by an index, displayed beside his/her name in the student list.
* To delete a student, you can use the command `delete` on the student's `INDEX`.
  The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶
* Deletes one student at a time.
* The index must have a student assigned to it.

How to identify `INDEX`:
![FAQ_IndexLocation](images/FAQ_IndexLocation.png) *Figure 6: Screenshot of index location.*

Examples of usage:
* `delete 2` removes the 2nd student on the list.
* `delete 10` removes the 10th student on the list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:**<br>

1. The `INDEX` used for each student is not fixed. It depends on the number shown on the displayed list of students.<br>

2. You can use `find` (section 3.7) to get his/her `INDEX` and then apply `delete`.<br>

3. This can save you time scrolling down an entire list to get his/her `INDEX`!<br>

4. Deletions can be reversed with the `undo` feature (section 3.5).

</div>

### 3.5. Undoing an action : Changed your mind?
You can `undo` an executed `add`, `edit` or `delete` command.

Format: `undo`
* Undoes only the last executed add, edit or delete command.
* You can only use the `undo` command after executing an add, edit, or delete command.
* Cannot be used in succession to undo previously executed commands besides the last executed one.

Examples of usage:
* Using `undo` after an `add` command will remove the recently added student.
* Using `undo` after an `edit` command will restore the details of the student back to his/her previous state.
* Using `undo` after a `delete` command will add the recently deleted student.

Scenario for undoing an edit command:
![UndoingAnEditCommand](images/UndoCommandScenario.png) *Figure 7: Scenario of using an undo command following an edit command.*

Figure *7* depicts a scenario in which an `undo` command is used to restore any previous changes made to a student using the `edit` command. Let's say you want to remove the tags for Jane Doe who is at index 3.
The command `edit 3 t/` will remove all tags from Jane Doe. In the scenario where you decide to change your mind on the removal, you can use the `undo` command to restore all of the student's tags.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:**<br>

1. After using an `undo` command successfully, you cannot use it again immediately.<br>

2. Using an `undo` command on an `edit` command will not restore the student's index back to his/her original index in the student list.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. If the student's original index is 1, using an `edit` command will place him/her at the last index of the student list with multiple students.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Using an `undo` command will not restore the student's index back to 1.

</div>

### 3.6. Redoing an action: Changed your mind yet again?

You can reverse an executed `undo` command with the `redo` feature.

Format: `redo`
* You can only use the `redo` command after executing an `undo` command.
* Cannot be used in succession to reverse previously executed `undo` commands besides the last executed one.

Examples of usage:
* Using `redo` after using `undo` on an `add` command will counteract the effect of undoing an `add` command and the overall result adds a student into the student list.
* Using `redo` after using `undo` on a `delete` command will counteract the effect of undoing a `delete` command and the overall result deletes the student from the student list.
* Using `redo` after using `undo` on an `edit` command will counteract the effect of undoing an `edit` command and the overall result edits the details of the student into the student list.

Scenario for redoing after undoing an edit command:
![RedoingTheUndoingAnEditCommand](images/RedoCommandScenario.png) *Figure 8: Scenario of using a redo command after using an undo command following an edit command.*

Following the scenario from *Figure 7*, *Figure 8* depicts the scenario in which you have decided once again to change your mind and remove the tags for Jane Doe. You can use the `redo` command to counteract the effects of the `undo` command on the `edit` command. At the end, all tags will be removed from Jane Doe.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:**<br> 

1. After using an `redo` command successfully, you cannot `redo` immediately again.<br>

2. Using a `redo` command after an `undo` command on an `edit` command will not restore the student's index back to his/her original index.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. If the student's original index is 1, using an `edit` command will place him/her at the last index of Tracey.<br>

3. Using a `redo` command after using an `undo` command will not restore the student's index back to 1.

</div>

### 3.7. Finding a contact: Looking for a particular student?
You can find a student using the student's full or partial name to retrieve their specific details using the `find` feature.

Format: `find NAME`
* Returns the student(s) whose name(s) contain the input keyword `NAME` with their **details**.
* A list of students will be returned along with their **details** including their `Name`, `Matriculation Number`, `Faculty`, `Block`, `Phone`, `Address`, `Email` and `Covid Status`.
* Your search can be case-insensitive. e.g. `johnDoe` will match `Johndoe`.
* Your input keyword does not need to be a full name. e.g. `jo` will match `Joe` and `John`.
* Your input keyword should contain the initial letters of the name. e.g. `jo` or`joh` for John. Conversely, if you input `ohn` for `John`, this will not warrant the correct result.

Examples of usages:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`.
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh` and`David Li`.
* `find J` returns `john` and`jay`.

Scenario:
![find](images/FindScreenshotForUG.png) *Figure 9: Screenshot of result of the find command.*

As seen in the *Figure 9*, after you input `find Bernice`, Tracey returns Bernice's details: `Name`, `Matriculation Number`, `Faculty`, `Block`, `Phone`, `Address`, `Email` amd `Covid Status`.

### 3.8. Filtering contacts: Need to find a particular group of students?
The `filter` feature is able to help you find students based on faculties, health statuses and/or blocks.

Format:`filter f/FACULTY cs/COVID_STATUS b/BLOCK`

* Returns a list of students that fit the criteria given by you in the form of pre-defined constants in the categories of faculty, covid status and block.
* Please refer to Table 4 in the [glossary](#6-glossary) for the list of pre-defined constants to be used for these 3 categories.
* Your search can be case-insensitive. e.g. `Positive` will match `positive`.
* The order of pre-defined constants specified does not matter e.g. `filter f/soc cs/positive` and `filter cs/positive f/soc` will return the same result.
* At least one pre-defined constant has to be specified, but not all need to be e.g. `filter` is invalid, but `filter b/A` is valid.

Examples of usage:
* `filter cs/positive` returns all students that are tagged as covid-positive.
* `filter f/soc` returns all students that are enrolled in the faculty SOC (School of Computing).
* `filter b/e` returns all students who live in block E of the hall.
* `filter cs/negative f/soc` returns all students that are tagged as covid-negative and enrolled in the faculty SOC (School of Computing).
* `filter cs/negative f/soc b/e` returns all students that are tagged as covid-negative, enrolled in the faculty SOC (School of Computing) and live in block E of the hall.

An example is shown below:
![find](images/FilterScreenshotForUG.png) *Figure 10: Example result of filter command.*

As seen in *Figure 10*, using the `filter` command with "negative" for covid status, "soc" for faculty and "e" for block will return a list of contacts matching these criteria.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:**<br>

1. `filter` command only allows you to search via faculty, health status and block. To search for contacts whose names contain a keyword, use the `find` command instead.

</div>

### 3.9. Listing the records: Want a complete overview of the students?
The `list` feature shows you all students, displaying all their data stored in the student list.

Format: `list`

This is a sample screenshot of what you can expect from the `list` command.

![list](images/ListFeatureScreenShot.PNG) *Figure 11: Screenshot of list command.*

### 3.10. Copying emails: Need to send an email to some students?
The `email` feature allows you to obtain the emails of students currently displayed in the list.

Format:`email`

![Email](images/CopyEmailScreenshot.png) *Figure 12: Screenshot of Copy Email function.*

From *Figure 12*, this function is beneficial for administrators like you to contact these students. Simply click the `Copy Email` button and go to the email platform of your choice and paste this in the Address section. This feature will increase the efficiently of obtaining student's email as you need not individually copy paste student emails.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:**<br>

1. Instead of inputting the command, you can also click the `Show Email` button on the GUI to open the same window.<br>

2. On the window, there will be a `Copy Email` button that copies the list of emails to your clipboard to allow you to efficiently send out mass emails.

</div>

### 3.11. Summarising the records: Want a detailed analysis of student's health status?
You can use the `summarise` feature to obtain the statistics of all student records in the student list.

Format:`summarise`
* You can get an overview of the students in the student list if you want to get an idea of the hall block or faculty where Covid is more prevalent.
* You can see which hall block and/or faculty has the highest number of Covid cases.

Example of usage:
* `summarise` will summarise the records of all students. The results is a graphical analysis of the `Covid Status` of the individuals in each block and/or faculty. Additionally, an overview of the `Covid Status` of the Hall population is also provided (refer to figure 4).

<img src='images/SummariseExample.png' alt='SummariseExample' width="400"/> 

*Figure 13a: Example pie charts of Tracey in response to the `summarise` command.*

<img src ='images/SummariseExample2.png' alt='SummariseExample2' width="400"/> 

*Figure 13b: Example bar chart of Tracey in response to the `summarise` command.*

From *Figure 13a and 13b*, when you input the `Summarise` command, the results are multiple charts of the proportion of the student population categorised by `Covid Status`. These charts are separated into the student `Blocks` and the wider hall population.

### 3.12. Archiving your data: Want to save the current version of Tracey?
You can use the `archive` feature to save the current version of Tracey. The archived file will be saved in `ROOT/data/archive/DIRECTORY/ARCHIVED_FILE` where:
* `ROOT`: The folder where the Tracey.jar is in.
* `DIRECTORY`: Archived file directory named using your local PC's date in the format of DDMMYY.
    * The day is abbreviated as DD, the month is abbreviated as MM and the last two digit of the year is abbreviated as YY.
* `ARCHIVED_FILE`: Archived file name named using your local PC's date and time in the format of DDMMYY_HHmmssSSS which is stored as a `json` file.
    * The hour is abbreviated as HH, the minute is abbreviated as mm, the seconds is abbreviated as ss and the milliseconds is abbreviated as SSS.

Format: `archive`

Examples of usage:
* Given the current date and time on your local PC in which the `archive` command is used: 27/03/2022 (DD/MM/YYYY) 15:28:33:123 (HH:mm:ss:SSS in 24-hour notation).
    * The archived file will be saved **in** `ROOT/data/archive/270322`.
    * The archived file will be saved **as** `270322_152833123.json`. (`json` is the suffix (after the period) to indicate the file type)
    * The file path will be `ROOT/data/archive/270322/270322_152833123.json`.
* To retrieve your archived file:
    1. Open the folder in which your Tracey.jar is stored in.
    2. Open the folder named `data`.
    3. Open the folder named `archive`.
    4. Open the folder named `270322`.
    5. Your archived file is named `270322_152833123.json`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:warning: **Warning:**<br>

1. You should not change the suffix of the archived file to any other type except for `json` as only a `json` file is compatible with Tracey.<br>
2. You should not manually edit the database file i.e. edit directly from `addressbook.json`, as this feature will save an exact copy of it regardless of whether it is corrupted or not.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:**<br>

1. You can rename the archived file in the file path manually for easier reference.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Features for naming the archived file using the CLI will be available in later releases.<br>
2. To restore Tracey to a previous version, rename the archived file name to `addressbook.json` and replace the file in `ROOT/data` with the archived file.

</div>

### 3.13. Resizing the result display window: Is Tracey's response too long to view?
Fret not, you can use the `resize` feature that comes with 3 pre-set sizes for the result display window.

Format: `resize SIZE`
* There are only 3 options for `SIZE` which are 1, 2 and 3.
* The default result display window size is option 1.
* You can refer to Figure 14 for the comparison of the different result display window sizes.

![Comparison of 3 resize options](images/resize_options.png) *Figure 14: Comparison of the 3 different resizing options for the result display window.*<br>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

## 4. FAQ
1. **Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? <br>
   **A**: You can copy the file from ROOT/data/addressbook.json over to your other computer. <br>

2. **Q**: What is the difference between the `list` command and the `summarise` command? <br>
   **A**: The main differences of `list` and `summarise` are:

   a. The `list` command will provide an unfiltered list of students while the `summarise` command will tabulate the students into pie charts according to the block they stay in and faculty they belong to.

   b. `list` is helpful to view the details of all the students whereas `summarise` is great to analyse how certain areas in the hall compound is doing.
   
   c. `list` is optimal to find a particular student out of everyone while `summarise` is optimal to find which block is suffering the most from the covid outbreak.

3. **Q**: Can I use `filter` to find certain students using their names? <br>
   **A**: Unfortunately the `filter` command only allows you to search using covid status, faculty and/or block. Please use the `find` command instead which will allow you to search via the student's name. <br>

4. **Q**: Where can I find the `INDEX` of a student? <br>
   **A**: You can find the index located beside each individual student. <br>
   ![FAQ_IndexLocation](images/FAQ_IndexLocation.png) *Figure 6: Screenshot of index location.*

5. **Q**: The `delete` feature only allows me to delete via the `INDEX` assigned to each particular student. How do I know the `INDEX` of the student I want to use `delete` on? <br>
   **A**: The `INDEX` used for `delete` is not fixed. It is the number beside the student's name in the current list.
   You can use `find` NAME to get his/her `INDEX` and then apply `delete`. This can save you time scrolling down an entire list to get his/her `INDEX`! <br>

6. **Q**: The `edit` feature only allows me to edit via the `INDEX` assigned to each particular student. How do I know the `INDEX` of the student I want to use `edit` on? <br>
   **A**: The `INDEX` used for `edit` is not fixed. It is the number beside the student's name in the current list. You can use `find` NAME to get his/her `INDEX` and then apply `edit`. This can save you time scrolling down an entire list to get his/her `INDEX`! <br>

7. **Q**: Can I create new tags not mentioned by the app? <br>
   **A**: Yes! You are able to add optional tags with no restrictions using the `t/` prefix.
