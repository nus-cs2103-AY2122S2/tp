ArchDuke is an **application to help students manage student contacts, groups, and group tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
This product is also optimized for students to **update and keep track of members of student groups and tasks in each group**.
If you can type fast, ArchDuke can get your contact management, group management, and task management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

# Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `archduke.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ArchDuke.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all student contacts.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/12345678 e/johndoe@u.nus.edu a/Computer Science t/friends` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to ArchDuke.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all entries in ArchDuke.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, **only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken**.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

There is no need to save manually.

## Student Contact Management

### Add student contact information: `add`

Adds a student contact information to ArchDuke. `add` must be followed by the student’s `NAME`, 
`PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, and `ACADEMIC_MAJOR`. `TAG` is optional and is one word consisting of letters and/or numerals (alphanumeric). 
`TAG` is case-sensitive.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ACADEMIC_MAJOR [t/TAG]...`

* Adds a student contact with the following attributes to the student contact list.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

A student contact can only be added if it **has yet to exist** in ArchDuke. The student contact 
is uniquely identified by his `PHONE_NUMER` and/or `EMAIL` with **no regards to case sensitivity**. E.g. `example@u.nus.edu` would be the 
same email as `Example@u.nus.edu` as in the real-word, emails are usually not case-sensitive.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Tip:**<br>

A student contact can have any number of tags (including 0). Same tags (case-sensitive) can only be added to a particular student contact once.

* `add n/Joel Lee p/87654321 e/joellee@u.nus.edu a/Information Systems`

Expected outcome:

* Student’s contact information is visible in ArchDuke and added to student contact list.

### Delete student contact information: `delete`

Deletes a student's contact information at the specified `INDEX` from ArchDuke.
The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the **currently displayed** student contact list. 
The `INDEX` **must be a positive unsigned integer** not exceeding the total number of currently displayed student contacts. The deleted student contact would also be 
deleted from all his currently assigned groups.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the student contact at that `INDEX` from the student contact list.

| Parameter | Representation                             | Constraints                                                                                        |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `INDEX`   | The number in front of the student contact | Must be positive unsigned integer and must not exceed the size of the current student contact list |

Example: 

* `delete 1`
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the second person in the current list from ArchDuke.
* `find n/Bernice` followed by `delete 1` deletes the first person in the current resulting list of the `find` command.

Expected outcome:

* The student contact is removed from ArchDuke. The student contact is also removed from all previously assigned groups.

### Locating student contacts by attributes: `find`

Locates all student contacts in ArchDuke based on attributes that matches the given keywords. 
* The attributes supported are: `n/NAME`, `p/PHONE_NUMER`, `e/EMAIL`, `a/ACADEMIC_MAJOR`, `t/TAG`
* The specified keywords are **case-insensitive**. 
* The attributes could be accessed by adding prefixes before the keywords.
* Only one prefix is allowed (e.g. `find n/Alice p/86472814` will throw an error, but `find n/Alice` or `find p/86472814` will work).
* The result must match the **exact word**, partial word will not match (e.g. `n/Dav` will not match the student contact
`David` or `David Li` as there is no word `Dav`).
* The command will list out all student contacts that matches the keyword.
  * `find n/Alex` would match with `Alex Yeoh` and `Alex Yu`.
  * `find n/Alex Yeoh` would match with `Alex Yeoh` and `Alex Yu`.
  * `find n/Alex Yu` would match with `Alex Yeoh`, `Alex Yu`, and `Bernice Yu`.
  
#### Attributes that support multiple findings

* The attributes that support **multiple findings** at the same time are `n/NAME`, `a/ACADEMIC_MAJOR`, and `t/TAG`.
  * `find n/Alex David` is possible and would show two results as `Alex Yeoh` and `David Li`, assuming that these are the only matching contacts.
  * `find a/Computer Science Business` is possible and would show contacts that have the following major: `Computer Science`, `Business`, `Business Analytics`
  , assuming that these majors are the exhaustive majors in the student contacts.
  * `find t/friends colleagues` is possible and would show contacts that have the at least one of the 2 tags: `friends` and `colleagues`.

Format: `find PREFIX/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...` for these `PREFIX`: `n/`, `a/`, `t/`

Prefix | Representation   | Constraints of keywords                                                                                                                                        |
--------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
`n/` | `NAME`           | Follow the restrictions of the `NAME` attribute                                                                                                                |
`a/` | `ACADEMIC_MAJOR` | Follow the restrictions of the `ACADEMIC_MAJOR` attribute                                                                                                      |
`t/` | `TAG`            | Follow the restrictions of the `TAG` attribute (however `t/` can be followed by more than one word tag for multiple seach of tags unlike in the `add` command) |

#### Attributes that does not support multiple findings

* The attributes that **does not support multiple findings** at the same time are `p/PHONE_NUMBER` and `e/EMAIL`
  * `find e/example@u.nus.edu student@u.nus.edu` is not possible as `find` command only supports finding one `EMAIL` at a time (e.g. `find e/example@u.nus.edu` or `find e/student@u.nus.edu`).
  * `find p/12345678 87654321` is not possible as `find` command only supports finding one `PHONE_NUMBER` at a time (e.g. `find p/12345678` or `find p/87654321`).

Format: `find PREFIX/KEYWORD` for these `PREFIX`: `e/`, `p/`

| Prefix | Representation | Constrains of keywords                                  |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `e/`   | `EMAIL`        | Follow the restrictions of the `EMAIL` attribute        |
| `p/`   | `PHONE_NUMBER` | Follow the restrictions of the `PHONE_NUMBER` attribute |

Example:

* `find n/Alex David` or `find n/Alex`
* `find p/98765432`
* `find e/example@u.nus.edu`
* `find a/Computer Science` or `find a/Security`
* `find t/friends colleagues` or `find t/colleagues`

Expected outcome:

* Lists all student contacts that match with those attributes and displays the number of student contacts that 
match those keywords.

## Student Group Management

### Create a group: `addgroup`

Creates a group in ArchDuke. `addgroup` must be followed by `GROUP_NAME`, which can take any values, 
and it **should not be blank** and **should not have preceding whitespaces**. `GROUP_NAME` with preceding white spaces
followed by words will be treated as if there is no preceding white spaces. E.g. <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group</code> is the same as `Group`.

Format: `addgroup g/GROUP_NAME`

* Adds a group with the name `GROUP_NAME` to the group list.

| Parameter    | Representation                | Constraints                                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GROUP_NAME` | Name of the group to be added | Should not be blank and should not have preceding whitespaces |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

A group can only be added if it **has yet to exist** in ArchDuke. The group
is uniquely identified by a `GROUP_NAME` with **no regards to case sensitivity**. E.g. `NUS` would be the
same group as `Nus` and `nus`

</div>

Example: 

* `addgroup g/CS2103-W16-3`

Expected outcome: 

* Creates a group with the name CS2103-W16-3 to ArchDuke.

| Parameter    | Representation                  | Constraints                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GROUP_NAME` | Name of the group to be deleted | Should not be blank and should not have preceding whitespaces |

Example: 

* `delgroup g/CS2103-W16-3`

Expected outcome: 

* Deletes the group with the name CS2103-W16-3 from ArchDuke.

### Assign a student to a group: `assign`

Assigns a student to an existing group in ArchDuke. `assign` is followed by the `INDEX` at which the student is 
in the **currently displayed** ArchDuke student contact list and the `GROUP_NAME` in which the student would be assigned. 
The group must **already exist** in ArchDuke, and the `INDEX` must be a **positive unsigned integer** 
not exceeding the total number of currently displayed student contacts. The student contact **must have yet to be currently assigned** to the group. 

Format: `assign INDEX g/GROUP_NAME`

* Assigns the student at index `INDEX` to the group called `GROUP_NAME`

Example:

* `assign 3 g/NUS Fintech Society`

Expected outcome:

* Assigns the specified student to the specified group.
