--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `UniGenda.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/releases)*.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your UniGenda.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Also note the name for each section of the UI, as it will be referenced throughout the User Guide.<br>
   ![Ui](images/UiWithExplanation.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all persons in `UniGenda`.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a person named `John Doe` to UniGenda.

   * **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd person shown in the current person list.

   * **`addEvent`**`1 ed/CS2103T Tutorial da/2022-03-16 ti/10:00 du/1` : Adds a CS2103T Tutorial event to the first person.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
   
Refer below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* All leading and trailing whitespaces will be trimmed for each input to each prefix.

* All commands are case-insensitive. For example `addevent` or `AdDEvenT` works for `addEvent` commands.

* The indices, i.e., INDEX and EVENT_NUMBER are integer based. Hence, the maximum value of an index is 2147483647.

## 5. FAQ

**Q**: How do I save the data file?<br>
**A**: UniGenda's data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

**Q**: Is there any way for me to edit the data file?<br>
**A**: UniGenda data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing it.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, UniGenda
will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

**Q**: Why do some starting dates of the Events change when I launch UniGenda on different days?<br>
**A**: `UniGenda` will update the date of the recurring event once it passes the ending date of the event so that it reflects the next occurrence of that event.

**Q**: Can I check if my contacts were free last week?<br>
**A**: Yes, however, the results might not be what you expect. This is because the events' dates are might change when you restart the application.

**Q**: Why I can check if my contacts were free last week?<br>
**A**: There can exist non-recurring events in a person's schedule. Therefore, we allow the ability to search the availabilities of your contacts' past events if you wish to.

**Q**: Why does `UniGenda` have sample data when it is first launched?<br>
**A**: Sample data is preloaded onto the application to allow for users to be able to familiarise themselves with the features of `UniGenda` by being able to experiment easily without having to manually add events and persons one by one. To start afresh, you may use the `clear` command to clear existing data.

**Q**: Why do some starting dates of the Events change when I launch UniGenda on different days?
**A**: `UniGenda` will update the date of the recurring event once it passes the ending date of the event so that it reflects the next occurrence of that event.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data folder with the folder that contains the data of your previous `UniGenda` home folder.

**Q**: Where do I locate my export files?<br>
**A**: <br>
**Case 1**: If steps in the Quick Start guide were followed, a folder named `data` should appear in the same folder as your `UniGenda` application. The exported file would be in `data/export/` folder.<br>

**Case 2**: If the application is opened with terminal or command prompt, **ensure** that you are in the correct directory that the `UniGenda` application is in before entering the command: `java -jar UniGenda.jar`. A folder named `data` should appear in the same folder as your UniGenda application. The exported file would be in `data/export/`.
