NUSocials is a **desktop app for university students to maintain a professional contact list, where users can keep track of information about friends/acquaintances easily in one single platform.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The value of the app is to facilitate a convenient way for university students to manage their professional networks with fellow acquaintances.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are mandatory parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Kim Lai`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [edu/EDUCATION]` can be used as `n/Kim Lai edu/computer science` or as `n/Kim Lai`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used zero or more times.<br>
  e.g. `[m/MODULE]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `m/CS2040S`, `m/CS2030S m/CS2100` etc.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `clear`, `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specified is `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, they will all be rejected.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12345678 p/87654321`, both will be rejected.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If an `INDEX` is used, it **must be a positive integer** (i.e. 1, 2, 3…​).

* All commands are case-sensitive.
