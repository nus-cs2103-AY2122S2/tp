ManageEZPZ is a **desktop app for that allows managers or supervisors to manage employees and assign tasks to them.  Optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `ManageEZPZ.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ManageEZPZ.

4. Double-click the file to start the app.

5. Start communicating with ManageEZPZ using the command box.

6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`listTask`** : Lists all Tasks.

   * **`addEmployee`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to ManageEZPZ.

   * **`deleteTask`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd Task shown in the Task list.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes **ALL** data from ManageEZPZ.
   
   * **`addTodo desc/read book`** : Adds a todo task with a description of `read book` to the Task list.

   * **`tagTask 1 n/John Doe`** : Assigns the first task on the task list to an employee named John Doe.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addEmployee n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Parameters for adding employees can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Task related commands must be strictly lower case.

* Task related parameters must be in sequence as shown in the instruction.

* Parsing parameters of a task is done using the keywords such as `desc/`, `by/` & `at/`, as such, the parsing mechanism would take everything inserted after the keywords.

* All indexes are int based, as such the maximum value is 2147483647 (2<sup>31</sup> - 1).

  and mm should only be between 00 and 59.

and time field to be edited. 
* You can update a task with the same description, date and/or time.  

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Examples: <br/>

Given a task list as follows... <br/>
