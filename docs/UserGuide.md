**Introduction**<br>
TAPA (Teaching Assistant's Personal Assistant) is a desktop app that allows TAs to better manage their student’s contact details and progress, especially for TAs who are teaching multiple classes/modules at the same time. It is optimised for use on a CLI.

**Purpose of This User Guide**<br>
The intended audience of this guide includes TAs who are interested in using TAPA, and anyone interested in learning more about TAPA. This guide aims to get you started with TAPA, and introduce you to all the features TAPA has to offer. As mentioned earlier, TAPA operates on a CLI. If you have no prior experience with a CLI, you can learn more about this in the [Features](#features) section introduction.

**Using This User Guide**<br>
This guide offers explanations for each feature found in TAPA, as well as how to use them to meet your student management needs. If you want to get started with TAPA as soon as possible, simply follow our [Quick Start](#quick-start) tutorial. Otherwise, you can find an overview of the features discussed in this guide in the following Table of Contents:

## Information about contacts in TAPA

After reading the Quick Start guide, you probably have a good idea of how to interact with TAPA. Using the CLI, you can add or delete students, as well as assign tasks to them and check their task progress. This section provides an explanation of the contact information that each student can have. Each student can be added to TAPA with the following fields:

| Field           | Prefix | Description                                                        | Restrictions                                                                                                                                                                     | Multiplicity            |

**:information_source: Note:** <br>

* Multiplicity refers to the number of instances of each field that a student can have (e.g. a student can have either 0 or 1 phone numbers associated to him/her).

* In TAPA, two students are considered the same only if they have the same student ID (i.e. multiple students can have the same module code/name/phone number/telegram handle/email address but not the same student ID).

* More details regarding the use of prefix can be found in the [Features](#features) section below.
</div>


## Features

**Introduction**<br>
TAPA offers a plethora of features at your disposal. However, you need to use different command formats to execute the various features. Before diving into TAPA's commands and features, do read the following notes to understand how to format your command inputs to TAPA:

<br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the "Format" section for each command:**<br>

* Each feature in this section has a "Format" descriptor that details how you should input the command in the command box for TAPA to execute. For example, to add a student to TAPA, you have to follow this format: `add i/STUDENT_ID n/STUDENT_NAME m/MODULE_CODE [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [t/TELEGRAM_HANDLE] [e/EMAIL_ADDRESS]​`. This may seem overwhelming at first, but do read on, and you will be a TAPA power user in no time.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  Example: For the command `edit STUDENT_INDEX`, `STUDENT_INDEX` is a parameter that you have to provide.<br>
  Thus, you should input the command `edit 10`, where "10" is the `STUDENT_INDEX`.

* Parameters in square brackets are optional parameters.<br>
  Example: For the command `edit STUDENT_INDEX [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [m/MODULE_CODE]`, you must supply the `STUDENT_INDEX` parameter in the input, whereas the `PHONE_NUMBER` and `MODULE_CODE` parameters are optional.<br>
  Thus, you can either input the command `edit 10 p/98765432` (`MODULE_CODE` not specified), or `edit 10 p/98765432 m/CS2103` (`MODULE_CODE` specified).

* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  Example: For the command `delete STUDENT_INDEX…​`, you can input `delete 10` (one `STUDENT_INDEX` parameter), or `delete 10 11 12 13` (multiple `STUDENT_INDEX` parameters).

* Parameters can be inputted in any order.<br>
  Example: For the command `add i/STUDENT_ID n/NAME m/MODULE_CODE`, you can input `add i/A0123456B n/John Doe m/CS2103` (`NAME` followed by `MODULE_CODE`) or `add i/A0123456B m/CS2103 n/John Doe` (`MODULE_CODE` followed by `NAME`). Both inputs will have the same result.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but the user specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  Example: For the command `find n/NAME`, if you input the command `find n/John n/Mary`, only `n/Mary` will be interpreted by TAPA.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  Example: For the command `help`, if you input `help help 123`, the input will be interpreted as `help`.
</div>

### Adding a student: `add`

Adds a student to TAPA.

**Format**: `add i/STUDENT_ID n/STUDENT_NAME m/MODULE_CODE [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [t/TELEGRAM_HANDLE] [e/EMAIL_ADDRESS]​`

* The student’s student ID (matriculation number), name as well as module code are compulsory fields.
* The phone number, telegram handle, and email address fields are optional and can be excluded.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:warning: <b>Warning!</b>

* The student's student ID (matriculation number) has to be unique.
* An error message will be displayed to the user if the specified student ID already exists in TAPA.

</div>

<br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <b>Notes:</b> <br>

* Other than the student ID, all other fields do not have to be unique. For example, two different students could share the same full name.
* The name of the student to be added will be converted to Title Case.
* The current version of TAPA expects that a TA will only teach each student in, at most, one module. Thus, each student to be added can only have one module code.
* You may refer to the [table](#information-about-contacts-in-tapa) above for more information about each individual field of a student.
</div>

**Example**:
* `add i/AXXXXXXXR n/john m/CS2103T p/98765432 t/johnnn e/e0123456@u.nus.edu`
    * A student named John is added to TAPA.

### Deleting previously assigned task: `deleteTask`

Deletes a task from a particular student's list of tasks.

**Format**: `deleteTask i/STUDENT_ID idx/INDEX` (or) `deleteTask m/MODULE_CODE tn/TASK_NAME`

An error message will be displayed if:
* the specified index is 0
* the specified index is a negative number
* the specified index is larger than the number of tasks for that particular student
* the student with the given student ID does not exist
* none of the students taking the module had previously been assigned the task with the given task name
* none of the students are taking a module with the given module code

**Example**:
* `deleteTask i/A0223456Z idx/2`
    * Deletes task at index 2 from the student's list of assigned task, provided that a task exists at that index.

### Viewing previously executed commands: `history`

Displays a list of previous commands that were executed successfully.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: <b>Quick Tip!</b><br>

* Aside from the `history` command, you can also use the :arrow_up_small: Up and :arrow_down_small: Down arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate through your previously executed commands.

</div>

**Format**: `history`

* Displays the list of previously executed commands in chronological order (from the earliest command to most recent command).
* The commands are displayed exactly as they were inputted by the user.
* The commands are indexed as 1, 2, 3, ......

<img src="images/UG-HistoryCommand-1.png">
<br>

### Undoing the previous command: `undo`

Reverts the changes made by the previously executed command.

**Format**: `undo`

* Reverts the changes of the previously executed command, and removes the command from history.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:warning: <b>Warning!</b>

* The effects of the [`clear` command](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#deleting-all-students-clear) and the [`undo` command](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#undoing-the-previous-command-undo) cannot be undone!

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <b>Notes:</b><br>

* While other apps may only allow the undoing of commands that alter stored details, TAPA's `undo` command can revert the changes of almost every command other than `clear` and `undo` itself. (This would include commands like `list`, `sort`, and `add`.) This feature is intended to aid the user in undoing their intended command, since it can be difficult to remember which commands can be undone, or to keep track of the last command that made changes to stored details.
* Inputting `undo` after the [`archive` command](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#archiving-details-in-the-address-book-archive) will not delete the copy of TAPA that has been saved in a separate file.

</div>

**Example**:
* `undo`
    * Displays the command that has been undone.
    * The changes made by the previously executed command are undone.
    * The undone command is removed from the history of commands.

### Sorting the list of students by the number of undone tasks: `sort`

Sorts and displays the students in TAPA by the number of undone tasks in **descending** order.

**Format**: `sort`

* Displays the students from the list of students by the number of undone tasks in **descending** order.
* The students are indexed as 1, 2, 3, ......

**Example**:
* `sort`
    * Displays all the enrolled students by the number of undone tasks in **descending** order.

| Before                                             | After                                              |

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I get started with TAPA?<br>
**A**: You can refer to the [Quick Start](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start) section of this guide to start using TAPA as soon as possible!

**Q**: I am not comfortable using a CLI. Do you have any tips on how I can get started?<br>
**A**: CLI refers to a Command Line Interface. As you may have noticed, rather than clicking buttons to operate TAPA, you type commands into the command box. TAPA was designed with fast typists in mind, who can make the most of a CLI to speed up their student management processes. To learn to use a CLI on your computer's terminal, you can read [this guide](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp). Alternatively, the [Features](#features) section of this guide explains how you can use the CLI in TAPA.

**Q**: I already know how to use TAPA. How can I view a list of available commands within TAPA?<br>
**A**: You can input the command `manual` to view the list of commands used within TAPA. Alternatively, you can refer to the [Command Summary](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#command-summary) section below.

**Q**: I have a question about TAPA that is not on the FAQ. **OR** I think a feature of TAPA does not function as expected. Who can I talk to about this?<br>
**A**: Feel free to reach out to one of our team members [here](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w09-4.github.io/tp/AboutUs.html). Alternatively, since TAPA is open-source, you can start developing TAPA to suit your needs [here](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w09-4.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html).

**Q**: Who developed this amazing app?<br>
**A**: You can find more details about our team on TAPA's [About Us](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w09-4.github.io/tp/AboutUs.html) page!

## Command summary

You can think of this Command Summary as a cheatsheet to using TAPA.
Each action that TAPA can perform is listed next to the format you should use to execute that command, as well as an example of how the command can be used.

For example, say you are using TAPA and would like to see the manual description for the `add` command.

As seen in the Command Summary below, you can input `manual add` to view a short description of the `add` command.

If you would like to learn more about a specific command, you can read more about it in the [Features](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#features) section above!
