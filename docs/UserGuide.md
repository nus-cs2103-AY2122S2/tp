Tinner (Anagram of Intern) is a desktop app for managing internship applications for students, optimized for use via a
Command Line Interface (CLI).
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Tinner allows you to easily
sort through and retrieve relevant information faster than traditional GUI apps.

Tinner aims to solve the hassle of managing internship applications though 3 aspects.

1. **Tracks** essential information such as statuses and deadlines at a glance.
2. **Reminds** you of important deadlines so that you will not miss anything about your application.
3. Allows you to **Review** the process and take down notes so that you can ace your next application.

The main purpose of this User Guide is to assist the user in learning how to use Tinner. The guide covers everything
from what the user sees, how Tinner can help the user, and even its limitations.

## General Symbols <a id="general-symbols"></a>

| Symbol |  What it means |
|:----------:|-------------|
| `list` |  Words that have a grey highlighted background are either commands or parameters |
|:bulb:|Useful tip|
|:warning:|Warning|
|:information_source:|Important piece of information |

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

## Command Format <a id="command-format"></a>

The following points explain the format of a command.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the [parameters](#technical-terminologies) to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addCompany n/COMPANY e/EMAIL`, `COMPANY` and `EMAIL` represent parameters which can be used like `addCompany n/Google e/hr@google.com`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/COMPANY [p/PHONE_NUMBER]` can be used as `n/Google P/65427981` or as `n/Google`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/COMPANY [p/PHONE_NUMBER]`, `[p/PHONE_NUMBER] n/COMPANY` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Additional non-[whitespace](#technical-terminologies) parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`) will result in an error.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, Tinner will throw an error and the command will not be executed.

* Duplicate company names are not allowed.<br>
  e.g. if there exists a company named `meta`, adding another company with the name `meta` is not allowed.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Commands are recognised by their [command word](#technical-terminologies). As such, if the command word is incorrect, even if it differs slightly from the correct command word, Tinner's response box will indicate that you have entered an unknown command.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Note that the invalid command messages in the response box will not specify the missing parameters in the command.

# Demo Use Cases <a id="demos"></a>
Use case describes an interaction between the user and Tinner for a specific functionality.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Note that some of these demos may be outdated, as such do remember to
update the reminder date if you  follow the demo as [reminder dates cannot be in the past](#c-role-restrictions).

</div>

## Use cases <a id="use-cases"></a>
* [Use Case #1: Applying to a role in a company](#usecase1)
* [Use Case #2: Deleting a company or a role](#usecase2)
* [Use Case #3: Editing a company or a role](#usecase3)
* [Use Case #4: Setting reminder window for reminder list](#usecase4)
* [Use Case #5: Favouriting a company](#usecase5)
* [Use Case #6: Finding a role](#usecase6)

## Use Case #1: Applying to a role in a company <a id="usecase1"></a>

Say you found a company with an opening that you are interested in. You did your research and found relevant information
pertaining to the company and the role. Here's how you can input this data in the application:

* [Add the company](#c-add-c) to the company list.


   ![AddCompanyDemo](images/AddCompanyDemo.png)

* [Add the role](#c-add-c-r) under the added company.


   ![AddRoleDemo](images/AddRoleDemo.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Note the successful command execution message in the response box upon successful adding of
the role. This applies for this use case and all other use cases listed.

</div>

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

## Use Case #2: Deleting a company or a role <a id="usecase2"></a>

Perhaps for some reason, you decide not to go through with an application. Maybe you realised the company's mission and
vision were not in line with your values or maybe you realised the role isn't for you. Here's how you can delete these
entries from the application:

* [Delete the role](#c-delete-c-r) from a given company.


   ![DeleteRoleDemo](images/DeleteRoleDemo.png)

* [Delete the company](#c-delete-c) from the company list.


   ![DeleteCompanyDemo](images/DeleteCompanyDemo.png)

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

## Use Case #3: Editing a company or a role <a id="usecase3"></a>

Say you received an email for an interview and the point of contact's email is different. Here's how you can make
changes to the application:

* [Edit the company](#c-edit-c) from the company list.


   ![EditCompanyDemo](images/EditCompanyDemo.png)

Also, you can change the status of your internship application and set the reminder for the interview date by making
this entry:

* [Edit the role](#c-edit-r) from a given company.


   ![EditRoleDemo](images/EditRoleDemo.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Note the change in color of the [role tag](#tags).

</div>

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

## Use Case #4: Setting reminder window for reminder list <a id="usecase4"></a>

Assuming that the reminder date from [Demo Use Case #3](#usecase3) is within a week from today, upon the next launch of
Tinner, you will be able to see a reminder pop-out box like this:

<img src="images/ReminderDemo.png" alt="ReminderDemo" height="480">

If you do not see the intended reminder, it is likely that the reminder date is not within
the [reminder window](#c-setWindow-c).  
Thus, you can increase the reminder window by making this entry:

* [Set the reminder window](#c-setWindow-c) for the reminder list.


   ![WindowDemo](images/WindowDemo.png)

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

## Use Case #5: Favouriting a company <a id="usecase5"></a>

A scenario where multiple companies have sent you offers and you may want to store these companies in
a [list of favourites](#c-listfavourite) for ease of reference.  
You can favourite a company by making this entry:

* [Favourite a company](#c-favourite-c) from the company list.


   ![FavouriteDemo](images/FavouriteDemo.png)
   

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Note that the favourite company will be denoted by the star icon next to the company name.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Note that favouriting companies can be utilized in other ways, and not just to keep track of
companies which have sent you offers.

</div>

You can choose to unfavourite by making this entry:

* [Unfavourite a company](#c-favourite-c) from the company list.


   ![UnfavouriteDemo](images/UnfavouriteDemo.png)

Finally, you can make a quick reference by listing all favourite companies using the [`listFavourite`](#c-listfavourite)
command.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

## Use Case #6: Finding a role <a id="usecase6"></a>
In the future when you have many applications, finding specific applications can be daunting. The
[find command](#c-find-c-r) allows you to search for applications easily with keywords matching `COMPANY_NAME` and `ROLE_NAME`.

Say you are interested in finding out what are the roles you had applied to at Amazon,
you can make this entry:
* [Finding a company](#c-find-c-r) from the company list.


   ![FindCompanyDemo](images/FindCompanyDemo.png)

Then after realising that you have an offer for a backend role at Amazon, you want to check out the progress of similar roles.
You can search for other backend roles by making this entry:
* [Finding all roles](#c-find-c-r) from the company list.


   ![FindRoleDemo](images/FindRoleDemo.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: Find a specific role in a specific company by providing both `COMPANY_NAME` and `ROLE_NAME`. E.g. `find c/amazon r/backend engineer`.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: After performing the find command, the response box will contain role and company keywords which you have previously entered.

# Features <a id="features"></a>

## Modifying Companies <a id="c-modifying-companies"></a>

This section pertains to modifying the data of a company item as stored by Tinner.

### Adding a company: `addCompany` <a id="c-add-c"></a>

The most fundamental command in Tinner. Much like storing contact details in an address book, save details about a
company that may come in handy during the internship application process.

**Function:** Adds a company that does not exist in the list.

**Format:** `addCompany n/COMPANY_NAME [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS]`

* More restrictions for command [parameters](#technical-terminologies) can be found [here](#c-company-restrictions)

**Examples:**

* `addCompany n/Google p/98765432 e/hr_google@gmail.com a/70 Pasir Panjang Rd, #03-71 Mapletree Business City II, Singapore 117371 `
* `addCompany n/Meta p/91234567 e/hr_meta@meta.com a/9 Straits View, Marina One, Singapore 018937`
* Refer to [Demo Use Case #1](#usecase1) for an example use case.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: The `EMAIL` and `PHONE_NUMBER` are fields to store the contact details belonging to the Point of Contact (POC) after applying for a role at the company. This POC could be a representative from a job seeking agency.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">
:warning: If a prefix is specified, even for optional fields, the value after the prefix cannot be blank. e.g. `p/` only is not valid but `p/94442222` is valid.  
</div>


[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

### Editing an existing company : `editCompany` <a id="c-edit-c"></a>

Added a company with `addCompany` but made a typo? The company recruitment team changed their email address? Fret
not, `editCompany` has got you covered. Simply edit the parts of the company details that you want updated.

**Function:** Edits the specified company within the displayed company list.

**Format:** `editCompany COMPANY_INDEX [n/COMPANY_NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS]`

* Edits the company at the specified INDEX. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed company list.
  The index must be a positive [integer](#technical-terminologies) 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
  * `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL` and `ADDRESS` fields can be left blank, allowing you to remove previously added information which may be erroneous.
* More restrictions for command [parameters](#technical-terminologies) can be found [here](#c-company-restrictions)

**Examples:**

* `list` followed by `editCompany 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the 1<sup>st</sup> company in the displayed company list.
* `list` followed by `editCompany 1 p/ e/` removes `PHONE_NUMBER` and `EMAIL` from the 1<sup>st</sup> company in the displayed company list.
* Refer to [Demo Use Case #3](#usecase3) for an example use case.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

### Deleting a Company : `deleteCompany` <a id="c-delete-c"></a>

Delete a company when you're not interested in them anymore with `deleteCompany`. This will help you keep your list of
companies less clustered and thus more organised.

**Function:** Deletes the specified company within the displayed company list.

**Format:** `deleteCompany COMPANY_INDEX`

* Deletes the company at the specified `COMPANY_INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed company list.
* The index must be a positive [integer](#technical-terminologies) like 1, 2, 3, …
* Refer to [Demo Use Case #2](#usecase2) for an example use case.

**Examples:**

* `list` followed by `deleteCompany 2` deletes the 2<sup>nd</sup> company in the displayed company list.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: Deleting a company would also delete all roles and information belonging to it. Since there is no undo feature, please double check before using this command.

</div>

### Favouriting a specific company: `favourite` <a id="c-favourite-c"></a>

We all have those few companies that we're particularly interested in. Use `favourite` to visually tag a company with a
star to let it stand out from the rest.

**Function:** Favourite a specific company from the list of companies.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) <a id="faq"></a>

**Q**: Do I need to save my data manually?<br>
**A**: No, you don't. Your list of companies is saved automatically after each user command.

**Q**: Why is there already data in Tinner when I first launch the application?<br>
**A**: When you use Tinner for the first time, Tinner creates a list of companies with sample data containing a set of
default companies and roles. You may use the command `clear` if you wish to erase all the sample data.

**Q**: Where is my data saved?<br>
**A**: When you use Tinner for the first time, a folder named data is created in the application's home directory
containing a file named "companyList.json". The list of companies is stored within this file.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer. Overwrite the empty data file it creates with the data file from your
previous Tinner home folder.

**Q**: What happens if I clear the company list accidentally using `clear`?<br>
**A**: Please ensure that you only use the command `clear` when you are certain that you want to erase the company list.
There are currently no features to revert the `clear` command.
