MyGM is a **desktop app for high school basketball team trainers to manage players’ data and schedules, optimized for use
via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, MyGM can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* Table of Contents
{:toc}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your Computer.

2. Download the latest `MyGM.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for `MyGM.jar`. You should put it in an **empty folder** in which the app is **allowed to create files** (i.e. do not use a write-protected folder). Alternatively, You can copy it to your desktop.

4. Double-click the file to start the app (**Mac users** are recommended to type `java -jar MyGM.jar` in the terminal). The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds (note that there might be slight differences in different OS).<br>
The GUI is split into two parts: Players and Schedules respectively. Details of the GUI are shown below

|             **Player**              |             **Schedule**              |
|:-----------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| ![Ui_Players](images/UiPlayers.png) | ![Ui_Schedule](images/UiSchedule.png) |


6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`add`**`P/ n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com h/183 w/70 j/24 t/PG` : Adds a player named `John Doe` to MyGM.

   * **`add`**`S/ n/training r/shooting training d/01/01/2023 1800` : Adds a schedule called `training` to MyGM.

   * **`delete`**`P/John Doe` : Deletes the player John Doe from MyGM.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all players, lineup and schedule.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

7. Refer to the Features below for details of each command.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. <br>e.g. in `add L/ n/LINEUP_NAME`, `LINEUP_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add L/ n/allstars`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. <br> e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/PG` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with …​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times. <br> e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/SF`, `t/PF t/C` etc.
* Commands are case-sensitive. `Add` is considered as an invalid command, the correct command should be `add` which is in lower case.
* Leading and trailing white spaces for parameters are trimmed. <br> e.g. `delete P/     John Doe` will be treated as `delete P/John Doe`
* Parameters can be in any order. <br> e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER, p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you have specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken. <br>e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored. <br> e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as help.

</div>

### 2.1. Viewing insights

Views some insights about players in the club and upcoming schedules.

* The right half of the application is used to display aggregated information about the club.
* Under the **Player** section, a pie chart showing the distribution of players by position in the club and a recruitment suggestion based on the distribution are given. Specifically, if one or more position contains noticeably fewer players than the average, or any position contains less than 2 players (1 starting and 1 reserved player), MyGM will remind the user to recruit more players. Moreover, MyGM will remind the user to tag those untagged players to have a better understanding of the club.
* Under the **Schedule** section, a calendar representing the current month is shown. The date representing today and the dates containing schedules will be marked out.

|           **Player**            |          **Schedule**           |

</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q1:** How do I transfer my data to another Computer?
**A1:** Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q2**: Why does the `delete` and `edit` command for players require a case-sensitive full name?<br>
**A2**: Considering that these commands have side effects on the existing player data and are irreversible, we have decided that a case-sensitive full name for these commands is necessary. This is useful as it can serve as a reminder to the user which player he/she is editing or deleting. Furthermore, it may not necessarily slow down the user as generally, human beings tend to remember names easily as opposed to the index of the player in the application.
