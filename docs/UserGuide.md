Are you a small business owner or freelancer? Want an easy way to store your client's information, but there's no free and easy solution available?
No worries, CinnamonBun has got you covered! CinnamonBun enables you to keep track of your clients and their transaction records.

As a Command-line Interface (CLI) app, you'll never have to move your hands away from the keyboard to get all your tasks done.
If you can type fast, the CLI will allow you to execute your tasks quickly. While this may be daunting for a new user, it only takes a short time to get accustomed to CinnamonBun.

This guide aims to be the one-stop shop to get you up and running.

   Some example commands you can try:
   * `list`: Lists all clients.
   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`: Adds a client named `John Doe` to CinnamonBun.
   * `delete 3`: Deletes the 3rd client shown in the current list.
   * `clear`: Deletes all client records.
   * `undo`: Undo the last executed command.
   * `exit`: Exits the app.

## Commands

### Command Syntax

Commands in CinnamonBun can be broken down into several components.

`COMMAND_WORD PREAMBLE PREFIX/ARGUMENT...`

| Component      | Description                                                                                                                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | `COMMAND_WORD` | Trigger for the command to be executed.                                                                                              |
 | `PREAMBLE`     | Text before the first valid parameter prefix in the command. Certain commands may require a preamble.                                | 
| `PREFIX`       | Commands may have one or more arguments. The prefix specifies which arguments to map to the parameters. All prefixes end with a `/`. |
 | `ARGUMENT`     | The argument to pass to the command.                                                                                                 |

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-primary">:bangbang: **Attention**

* Commands and their arguments are case-sensitive
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but is specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
* Any invalid parameters for commands will be regarded as part of the value of the preceding parameter. For example:
  * In `addTransaction 1 a/123 td/2020-11-11 n/this is a note --not paid`, `--not paid` will be regarded 
  as part of the note `n/this is a note --not paid` since `--not paid` is not a valid attribute. 
  * In `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 t/vendor c/not a prefix t/owesMoney`, 
  `c/not a prefix` will be regarded as part of the preceding tag `t/vendor c/not a prefix` since `c/not a prefix` is 
  not a valid attribute/prefix.

</div>

### User Guide Syntax

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the arguments to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is an argument which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used zero or more times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family t/colleague` etc.

### Fields and Tags

A client can have many fields and tags, including both optional and compulsory ones.

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-primary">:bangbang: **Attention**

* Fields that can be sorted:

  * Address `a/`
  * Birthday `b/`

* At least one of the above fields must be specified.
* Specifying `desc` after a field will sort it in descending order. By default, fields are sorted in ascending order.
* The fields are to be specified in their prefix. They can be specified in any order, however, priority will be given
  based on the order specified.
* Clients with null values in the fields to be sorted will have lesser priority. 
  * For example `sort n/ b/`, 'Alice' will be at the top of the list. However, if there are multiple clients with the same name 'Alice',
  the client whose birthday field is empty, will be sorted to the bottom of the other clients named 'Alice'.
* After sorting, the application will show the full client list, regardless if it was filtered
  beforehand or not. This is to prevent confusion where users filter first, then sort and realized some data is 'missing'
  as they had unintentionally filtered it out.

</div>

Examples:
* `sort n/ desc p/`: Clients will be sorted in descending order of their name. Clients with the same name will be then sorted 
based on their phone numbers in ascending order.
* `sort b/ a/`: Clients will be sorted in ascending order of their birthday. Clients with the same birthday will then be sorted
based on their addresses in ascending order.

</div>

Examples:
* `find bob` returns clients with attributes containing `bob` e.g. clients named `Sponge Bob` and `Bobs Doe`

## Special Features

### Command Chains

Multiple commands can be chained by separating each command with the `|` character.

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info**

* Each command is run sequentially from first to last.
* Take note of indexes. E.g. `delete 7 | delete 8` may not work as expected as deleting item 7 will in turn cause item 8 to become item 7 which may result in unintended consequences. Instead, run `delete 7 | delete 7` which is what you would do anyway if you wanted to achieve the same effect by running each command individually. This is intended behaviour.
* If invalid commands and the special commands `help`, `exit` and `undo` are found anywhere in the command chain, the whole chain will be invalidated causing none of the commands in the chain - even valid commands - to execute.
* Anything bounded by the start of the command, the end of command and the `|` separators will be considered a command. E.g. `find alex | clearFiltered |` will be considered three commands, namely "find alex", "clearFiltered" and " ". Since the third command, " ", is empty and thus invalid, the first two will not execute.
* The user will only receive the command feedback of the last command. E.g. Running `delete 2 | add n/John p/81234567 e/john@email.com a/42 Doe St` will only show `Added John.` in the result box.

</div>


Examples:

* Valid command chain:

`add n/John p/81234567 e/john@email.com a/42 Doe St | edit 5 p/999 | delete 2`

* Invalid command chains:

`add n/John p/81234567 e/john@email.com a/42 Doe St | invalidCommand | delete 2` (add and delete commands will not execute as an invalid command was found)

`add n/John p/81234567 e/john@email.com a/42 Doe St | delete 2 | undo` (add and delete commands will not execute as a special command, in this case `undo`, was found)

`add n/John p/81234567 e/john@email.com a/42 Doe St |` (add command will not execute as the second command is empty and is thus invalid)

### Command History

You can navigate through your command history by using the up and down arrow keys.
The command history works similarly to the Linux bash terminal.

### Clickable Client Card

You can list all transactions of a client by left-clicking the client's card.
This is equivalent to typing `findTransaction INDEX` in the command box. Left-clicking a selected client card will deselect that card and list all transactions. Up to one client card can be selected at anytime.

### Themes

You can change between the light or dark theme by click on the menu bar and selecting `Theme > Cinnamon` or `Theme > Caramel`.

![ChangeTheme](images/ChangeTheme.png)

### Command Correction/Completion

Pressing `TAB` while typing a command will change the last word of the command into the closest command word.

Examples:
* `dele` -> `delete`
* `sddTranssaction` -> `addTransaction`
* `delete 7 | ed` -> `delete 7 | edit`
