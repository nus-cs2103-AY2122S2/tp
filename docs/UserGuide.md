6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addfriend n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addfriend n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `listfriends`, `listevents` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `listfriends 123`, it will be interpreted as `listfriends`.

* Arguments connected by a `?` are exclusively-or - i.e. only one or the other can be provided.
  e.g. in `addlog INDEX ? n/NAME`, either `INDEX` or `NAME` must be provided, but not both.
</div>

## Friend Management
_Amigos_ is designed to help you keep track of the friends in your life.

### Adding a friend: `addfriend` or `af`

Adds a new friend to _Amigos_.

**Format**: `addfriend n/NAME  [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL]  [a/ADDRESS] [d/DESCRIPTION] [t/TAG]…`

* Note that `NAME` field is minimally compulsory. `p/`, `e/`, `a/` and `d/` `t/` flags and their arguments are optional.
* Note that friend names should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces
* Note that there can be no duplicate friends having the same name (case-insensitive).
* Note that names have to be exactly matched (in a case-insensitive manner) to be considered as duplicates. For example,
  John Doe and John &nbsp; Doe (with the extra space) are considered as different friends.

**Examples**:

* `addfriend n/John Doe p/98765432 a/John street, block 123, #01-01 t/Classmate` will result in the following friend being added.

![Addfriend_JohnDoe](images/Addfriend_JohnDoe.png)

* `addfriend n/John Doe t/Friend t/Banker`

### Editing a friend : `editfriend` or `ef`

Edits an existing friend in _Amigos_.

**Format**: `editfriend INDEX ? cn/CURRENT_NAME [nn/NEW_NAME]  [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [d/DESCRIPTION] [t/TAG]...`

* Edits an existing friend in _Amigos_.
* Either a specified `INDEX` or `CURRENT_NAME` of an existing friend in _Amigos_ must be provided.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be overwritten to the input values.
* Note that when editing tags, the existing tags of the friend will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.


**Examples**:
* `editfriend 1 a/John street, block 456, #01-01 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the address
  and email of the friend at `INDEX` 1 to be `John street, block 456, #01-01` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `editfriend cn/Alex Yeoh nn/Alex Tan` will change the name of `Alex Yeoh` to `Alex Tan`.

### Deleting a friend : `deletefriend` or `df`

Deletes a friend in _Amigos_.

**Format**: `deletefriend INDEX ? n/NAME`

* Either a specified`INDEX`or `NAME` of an existing friend in _Amigos_ must be provided.

**Examples**:
* `deletefriend n/John Doe`
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

|                  Before                   |                     After                     |
|:-----------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
| ![PreClear](images/Addfriend_JohnDoe.png) | ![PostClear](images/DeleteFriend_JohnDoe.png) |

* `deletefriend 1`

### Show a specific friend: `showfriend` or `sf`

Shows expanded page containing the full details related to an existing friend in Amigos.

**Format**: `showfriend INDEX ? n/NAME`

* Either a specified `INDEX` or `NAME` of an existing friend in _Amigos_ must be provided.
* When viewing the page containing the full details related to an existing friend, other commands dependent on `INDEX`
  will refer to the `INDEX` of the friend/event shown on the expanded friend page. For example, when viewing the expanded
  friend page of `Charlotte Tan`, entering `editevent 2 n/Dinner with Bernice`
  will update the name of `Charlotte Tan`'s current 2nd upcoming event to `Dinner with Bernice`. Similarly, `deletefriend 1`
  will remove `Charlotte Tan` from Amigos, since `Charlotte Tan` is the only friend currently being viewed on the 
  expanded friend page.
* Clicking on the `Events` tab directly after entering the `showfriend` command would only show events related to the 
  friend currently being viewed on the expanded friend page. 

**Examples**:
* `showfriend n/Bernice Yu` Will open up the page containing full details related to Bernice Yu - her name, address, 
   phone number, email, description, logs, and upcoming events with her.

* ![ShowFriendExample](images/ShowFriendExample.png)

* `showfriend 2` Will open up the page containing full details related to the friend at `INDEX` 2 on the filtered GUI list.


### List all friends : `listfriends` or `lf`

Lists all friends in _Amigos_. Switches GUI to the friends tab.

**Format**: `listfriends`

![ListFriendExample](images/ListFriendExample.png)

### Find friends : `findfriend` or `ff`

Find friends in _Amigos_ whose name, tags or logs' title matches ANY of the given keyword(s).

**Format**: `findfriend [n/NAME_KEYWORD]... [ttl/LOG_TITLE_KEYWORD]... [t/TAG_KEYWORD]...`

* Name, tags, and log titles will be searched.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `john` will match `John`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. Doe John will match John Doe
* As long as the keyword matches a substring of the name / log title / tags
  of a friend, the friend will be returned. e.g. `findfriend n/Jim` will return `Jimmy Tan` and `findfriend ttl/Dinner`
  will return friends with log titles containing the substring `Dinner`.
* Friends matching at least one keyword will be returned. e.g. `findfriend n/John ttl/John` will return `John Doe`, `John Tan`,
   as well as all friends with log titles containing the substring `John`.

**Examples**:
* `findfriend n/John t/neighbour` returns all friends with 'John' in the name or 'neighbour' in any of the tags.
* `findfriend n/John n/Emily n/Russel`returns all friends with 'John' or 'Emily' or 'Russel' in the name.

![FindFriendExample](images/FindFriendExample.png)

## Logs management
_Amigos_ provides functionality to manage logs, which are essentially detailed notes about a specific friend.

### Adding a log: `addlog` or `al`

Adds a log to an existing friend at the specified `INDEX` or with the specified `NAME` in _Amigos_.
The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed person's list.

**Format**: `addlog INDEX ? n/NAME ttl/TITLE [d/DESCRIPTION]`

* Exactly one of `INDEX` or the `NAME` fields is compulsory.
* The `DESCRIPTION` argument is optional.
* Note that duplicate logs are not allowed, and two logs are considered "duplicates" if they have the same title (case-sensitive). 
  The rationale for this is that users should be minimally able to tell logs apart at a glance without restrictions on content.

**Examples**:
* `addlog 1 ttl/has a pet named poki` adds a log to the person at index 1 of the "Friends" tab with the title "has a pet named poki".

![AddLogExample](images/AddLogExample.png)

* `addlog n/Benson Meier ttl/recommended movies d/the martian, interstellar, three idiots`

### Editing a log: `editlog` or `el`

Edits an existing log of an existing friend in _Amigos_.

**Format**:
`editlog INDEX ? n/NAME id/LOG_INDEX [ttl/NEW_TITLE] [d/NEW_DESCRIPTION]`

* Exactly one of `INDEX` or the `NAME` fields is compulsory.
* At least one of the `NEW_TITLE` or `NEW_DESCRIPTION` arguments must be provided.
  Both will directly overwrite the current values.
* Note that editing a log to be case-insensitively the same as an existing log is not recommended, but allowed.

**Examples:**
* `editlog n/John Doe id/1 ttl/has a pet named Poki`
* `editlog 1 id/1 d/the martian, interstellar, three idiots, peaky blinders`

### Deleting a log: `deletelog` or `dl`

Deletes an existing log or logs of an existing friend in _Amigos_.

**Format**: `deletelog INDEX ? n/NAME id/LOG_INDEX ? -a` or `deletelog -a`

There are three cases of usage: 
* If `INDEX` or `NAME` is provided as well as `LOG_INDEX`, then that specific log will be deleted.
* If `INDEX` or `NAME` is provided as well as a `-a` flag, then all logs of that person will
  be deleted.
* If only `-a` is provided, then all possible logs of all friends will be deleted.
  * Note that in the command summary, we present the above as `deletelog INDEX ? n/NAME [id/LOG_INDEX] [-a]` for convenience.

**Examples:**
* `deletelog n/John Doe id/1`

|                Before                 |                   After                   |
|:-------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
| ![PreClear](images/AddLogExample.png) | ![PostClear](images/DeleteLogExample.png) |

* `deletelog n/John Doe -a`
* `deletelog -a`

## Event Management
_Amigos_ also allows you to keep track of your social events!

![Events Page](images/EventPage.png)

### Creating an event: `addevent` or `ae`
Adds a new event, which can be optionally linked to any number of existing friends.

**Format**: `addevent n/EVENT_NAME dt/DATE_TIME [d/DESCRIPTION] [f/FRIEND_NAME]...`

* There **cannot** be any duplicate events with the same name and date.
* The `DATE_TIME` must be given in the following format: `DD-MM-YYYY hhmm`
* Individual fields are parsed intelligently where possible. Here are two examples (not comprehensive):
  * A day-of-month that is out of range for the given month will be automatically corrected to the last valid day-of-month. (`31-06-2020 1200` will be automatically adjusted to `30-06-2020 1200`)
  * If the time is given as `2400`, the final date-time will automatically jump to the next day with time `0000`
* All given `FRIEND_NAME` values must match the `NAME` of an existing friend in _Amigos_.

**Examples**:
* `addevent n/John’s Birthday dt/15-08-2022 1700 d/Remember to get a present! f/John Doe f/Alex Yeo`

![AddEventExample](images/AddEventExample.png)

* `addevent n/Christmas Party dt/25-12-2022 1930`

### Editing an event: `editevent` or `ee`
Edits an existing event.

**Format**: `editevent INDEX [n/EVENT_NAME] [dt/DATE_TIME] [d/DESCRIPTION] [af/ADD_FRIEND_NAME]... [rf/REMOVE_FRIEND_NAME]...`

* Edits the event at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed events list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* The `EVENT_NAME`, `DATE_TIME` and `DESCRIPTION` arguments directly overwrite the existing details.
* The `ADD_FRIEND_NAME` and `REMOVE_FRIEND_NAME` arguments add/remove friends tied to the event respectively, and must match the `NAME` of an existing friend in _Amigos_.

**Examples**:
* `editevent 2 dt/16-08-2022 1600 af/Jacky Jones rf/Sarah Lim rf/Alex Yeo` will edit the date & time of the 2nd event to `16-08-2022 1600`, adds `Jacky Jones`, and removes `Sarah Lim` and `Alex Yeo` from the event.

### Deleting events: `deleteevent` or `de`
Delete existing event(s).

**Format**: `deleteevent INDEX`

* Deletes the event at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed events list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

**Examples**:
* `deleteevent 2`

### List all events : `listevents` or `le`
Lists all the upcoming events in _Amigos_.

**Format**: `listevents [-a]`

* Switches GUI to the events tab
* if the `-a` flag is omitted it will only show upcoming events (Events with date and time after the system's date and time)
* if the `-a` flag is provided it will show all events in _Amigos_ 
  
**Examples**:
* `listevents`
* `listevents -a`

### Find events : `findevent` or `fe`

Find events in _Amigos_ whose properties match the given search criteria.

**Format**: `findevent [n/EVENT_NAME_SUBSTRING] [ds/DATE_START] [de/DATE_END] [f/FRIEND_NAME_SUBSTRING]...`

* For search by `EVENT_NAME_KEYWORD`/`FRIEND_NAME_KEYWORD`:
  * The search is **case-insensitive**. e.g john will match John
  * For each search field, an event is a match if the search substring matches
    * e.g n/Birthday will match events with names John's Birthday, Bob's Birthday
    * e.g. f/joe will match events containing either Joe Maggio or Joe Allen in the friends list.
    * Any leading or trailing whitespace in the search substring will be trimmed.

* For search by `DATE`:
  * The date must be given as follows: `DD-MM-YYYY`
  * `DATE_START` and `DATE_END` set the inclusive starting and ending date range to filter events by respectively
  * The date is interpreted intelligently where possible, similar to `DATE_TIME` in `addevent`
  * It is acceptable to provide only the `DATE_START` or `DATE_END`, if desired.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided
* If more than one field is given, only events with matches for **all** search criteria will be shown.
* All events, including past ones, will be checked for matches.

**Examples**:
* `findevent n/dinner ds/20-03-2022` returns events starting from 20 Mar 2022 with an event name containing 'dinner' 
* `findevent f/Joe f/John` will return events with a friends list containing both 'joe' and 'john'
