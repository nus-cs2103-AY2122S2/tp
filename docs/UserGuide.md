TAssist is a **desktop app for managing students and their participation in lessons, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI). If you are a TA who prefers CLI to GUI while having a GUI to view the student data, TAssist is the app for you.

* Table of Contents

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `TAssist.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TAssist.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`list student`** and pressing Enter will list all students added.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list student`**: Lists all students.

   * **`add student`**`id/E0123456 n/John Doe e/johnd@example.com`: Adds a student named `John Doe` to TAssist.

   * **`delete student`**`3`: Deletes the 3rd student shown in the listing of the entity.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TELEGRAM_ID]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/john_doe` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Only one group of arguments in curly braces can be used as argument. Each group is separated by a `|`.<br>
  e.g. `{m/MODULE_INDEX | c/CLASS_GROUP_INDEX}` can be used as `m/1` or as `c/1` but not as `m/1 c/1`.

* If multiple options are accepted for a parameter, only one option can be specified.<br>
  e.g. `s/all|STUDENT_INDEXES|STUDENT_IDS` can be used as `s/all`, `s/1,2,3,4,5,6` and `s/e0123456,e0234567` but not mix-and-matched as `s/all,1,2,e0123456`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME e/EMAIL`, `e/EMAIL n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `t/john_doe t/johnny_doe`, only `t/johnny_doe` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list student 123`, it will be interpreted as `list student`.
