title: User Guide

NUS Classes is a desktop app for NUS Computing professors to manage their tasks and contacts. It includes task management features such as 
creating tasks, tagging tasks, assigning contacts to tasks, and marking tasks as complete or incomplete. It also includes contact management features such as finding contacts, assigning contacts to specific tasks and tagging contacts. 

NUS Classes also provides a simple alert feature for tasks by displaying tasks in different color based on the urgency of the task. Tasks that are overdue are marked as red, whereas, tasks that are nearing deadline are marked as yellow.

NUS Classes is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
Using NUS Classes can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps, saving time on otherwise tedious administrative tasks.

This User Guide has been conveniently catergorised into **Contact Features**, **Task Features** and **Other Features**. This will help you locate quickly the command that you want to know more about.

Blue text boxes are additional tips and notes to enhance your experience with NUSClasses, while yellow text boxes are warnings that will cause NUSClasses to not function as intended. Graphics are also available to further aid us visually.

Hope you'll be satisfied using NUSClasses :smile:

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`listc`** : Lists all contacts.

    * **`addc`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@u.nus.edu u/john123 t/Schoolmate` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to NUS Classes,
   with email `johnd@u.nus.edu`, Github Username `john123` and tag `Schoolmate`

    * **`deletec`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current contact list.

   * **`assign`**`1 p/ 2` : Assigns the contact at index 2 to the task at index 1.

   * **`clear`** : Clears all contacts and tasks from NUS Classes

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `addc n/CONTACTNAME`, `CONTACTNAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `addc n/CONTACTNAME p/PHONENUMBER e/EMAIL u/GIT_USERNAME [t/TAG]…​` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `listc`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* `INDEX` refers to a single non-zero positive integer only, and within the bounds of the number of contacts/number of tasks. Values such as `-1`, `abc`, or `2 abcdefg` are invalid.

* Some examples have images of the usage of the commands in the User Interface. This is to allow you to easily visualize and understand what the commands do in that context.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Viewing help : `help`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:bulb: **Notes:**

* Make sure the contact's phone number is at least 3 digits long! Phone numbers with > 8 digits are allowed since international phone numbers have different numbers of digits.

* Github usernames can only consist of alphanumeric characters or single hyphens, and cannot begin or end with a hyphen. Usernames such as `john123` and `jo-hn123` are valid, but usernames such as `john123-`, `-john123` and `jo--hn123` are invalid.

The task that you are creating cannot have duplicate tags, tags are unique for that specific task e.g. `addt tn/Lecture dt/12-12-2022 1200 t/Weekly Lecture t/Weekly Lecture` would be invalid.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Notes about `TASK`:**<br>

* You can create overdue Tasks (with `DATETIME` before today) if you wish to remind yourself of overdue tasks! :smiley:
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Notes about `INTERVAL RECURRENCE`:**<br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**

If your `findt` command contains both name `KEYWORD` and date time prefix `dt/`,
 the command will ignore the `KEYWORD` and `findt dt/` will take higher precedence.
<br>
e.g. `findt meeting dt/12-12-2022 1200, 13-12-2022 1200` will be equivalent to 
`findt dt/12-12-2022 1200, 13-12-2022 1200`

* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Tut` will not match `Tutorial`
* Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Lecture Tutorial` will return `CS2103T Lecture`, `Tutorial 12`

**Examples**:
* `findt with` returns `Consultation with students` and `Meeting with invigilators`.
* `findt week` returns all recurring instances of `CS2103T Lecture` as their tags contain `Week XX Lecture`.
* `findt TAs lecture` returns `Meeting with TAs` and all recurrences of `CS2103T lecture`. <br>

</div>

#### 2. Finding tasks by date: `findt`
Find tasks whose task falls in between the given dates (inclusive).

**Format**: `findt dt/DATETIME1, DATETIME2`

* The ordering of date doesn't matter . e.g `dt/12-02-2022 0800, 13-03-2022 0800` will match `dt/13-02-2022 0800, 12-03-2022 0800`

* `import fp/contacts.csv` (all supported platforms) will import all valid entries from the `contacts.csv file` in the NUS Classes root folder.

### User-friendly date display

Instead of always displaying dates in full (e.g. DD MM YYYY), our dates will be displayed based on the current day to be more user-friendly. Here's a reference if you get confused:
