## Commands

This section provides an overview of all the available commands in MedBook. Click on any command below to see the complete details of the command.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [tg/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe tg/diabetic` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[tg/TAG]… ` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `tg/diabetic`, `tg/diabetic tg/hypertension` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `view`, and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

<h6 markdown="1">How do I transfer my data to another computer?</h6>

**Option 1:**
By default, MedBook will always read `medbook.json` located in `[HOME_DIRECTORY of MedBook.jar]/data/`. Just move your
data to `HOME_DIRECTORY of MedBook.jar/data/` in your new device if you wish to import them.

**Option 2 (with encryption):**
By default, MedBook will always encrypt your data to `password.enc` in `[HOME_DIRECTORY of MedBook.jar]/data/` for
security reason. You can move `password.enc` to `HOME_DIRECTORY of MedBook.jar/data/` in your new device and MedBook
will ask for your password upon launching.

<h6 markdown="1">What happens if I forget my password?</h6>
Due to security reason, there is no way to reset to password. To continue using the application you need to delete the 
encrypted data file (located at `[HOME_DIRECTORY of MedBook.jar]/data/password.enc`) or move it to another location. 
MedBook will start with a fresh data for you to start over. See the next FAQ for restoring data.

<h6 markdown="1">What happens if I accidentally remove `password.enc`?</h6>
Unfortunately, the encrypted data will be lost along with your password. However, you can restore your data if you have 
`medbook.json` with you. Make sure you place them in `[HOME_DIRECTORY of MedBook.jar]/data/` before launching the app. 
When you start MedBook again, you will be asked to set up a new password.

We highly discourage users to tamper with `password.enc` for security reason as any encryption can be broken given
sufficient amount of time.

<h6 markdown="1">Can I modify `medbook.json` locally?</h6>
We highly discourage users from modifying `medbook.json` directly as any invalid input will cause MedBook to launch with
empty data and `medbook.json` will be overwritten.

If you understand what you are dealing with, you may proceed with caution. We recommend you to back up a copy of
`medbook.json` in case you accidentally corrupt the file at any point in time.
