### Project: Trackermon

Trackermon is a desktop application for tracking and managing shows, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Trackermon helps people track and remember what shows they have watched, are currently watching, or plan to watch.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=aweijun&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-02-18)

* **New Feature**: Suggest a random show from the current displayed list of shows through the `suggest` command  [[\#185]](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/pull/185).
  * What it does: returns the user a random show from the currently displayed list of shows.

  * What it does: allows users to give a show a rating.
  * Justification: This feature is an important addition to Trackermon. The feature allows users to keep track of whether a show is good or bad.
  * Highlights: This enhancement would affect the existing commands, however implementation was relatively simple.
