## Project: Teaching Assistant Contact Helper (TACH)

TACH helps CS Teaching Assistants tutoring multiple modules & classes by keeping
track of their students and monitoring their progress on their tutorials.
It is optimized for CLI users so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing
in commands.

The following sections below summarise my contributions to this project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete tutorial groups of specific students.
    * What it does: Allows the user to delete tutorial groups one at a time for a specified student.
