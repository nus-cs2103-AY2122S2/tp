## Project: TeachWhat!
TeachWhat! is a desktop address book application used for private tutors in managing their class. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Enhancements implemented
* **Student Functionality**
   * What it does
     * Allows user to Add/Delete/Edit a `Student`.
   * (Pull requests [#71](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/71) and [#146](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/146))
* **Added support for optional prefixes in `Student`**
    * What it does
      * All prefixes except for `Name` and `Phone` are optional.
    * Justification
      * The user does not need to know the address or email of every student.
    * (Pull requests [#71](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/71))
* **Command Shortcuts**
   * What it does
     * Provides support for shortcut command words.
   * Justification
     * This makes typing faster, instead of typing `addstudent`, the user can simply use `as`.
   * (Pull requests [#145](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/145))
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
* **Help Page**
   * What it does
     * Displays a table with the description, command word, command shortcut for each command.
     * A hyperlink to TeachWhat! user guide.
   * Justification
     * It makes it easier for the user to refer to command words and their functionality using the table instead of 
        opening the user guide.
     * The user can simply click on the hyperlink to open it instead of copying it. This saves the user time.
   * (Pull requests [#158](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/158))  

### Contributions to the UG

### Contributions to team-based tasks
* Created and assigned tasks to milestones 1.3 and 1.4
* Created 1.3.1 release and uploaded its jar file  

### Review/mentoring contributions
* Made multiple good suggestions when reviewing pull requests such as [#92](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/92#issuecomment-1072136978)
* Debated with [james](https://github.com/jamesyeap) during a weekly meeting about how command shortcuts were to be implemented and justified my use of `Fallthroughs` over creating a list to hold all the command words for every command because we decided to not implement user specified keybinds.
* Spotted bugs made that were not caught such as [#249](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/issues/249) and [#73](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/73) and provided suggestions to fix them.
