### Project: NUSocials

NUSocials is a desktop address book application for university students who like to maintain a professional contact list. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Feature Enhancement**: Added the ability to delete multiple contacts. [(#34)](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/pull/34)
  * What it does: allows the user to delete multiple contacts in a single command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product as a user can efficiently delete many contacts at once instead of inputting a delete command for each contact that he or she wants to delete.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing UI layout. It required an in-depth analysis of how the contacts would be displayed during the deletion process.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to remove tags from existing contacts. [(#52)](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/pull/52)
  * What it does: allows the user to remove tags from an existing contact.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to simply remove a tag, otherwise users have to recreate another contact.

* Updated the UI to fit requirements for new features [(#70)](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/pull/70)
  * Added a split-pane to fit 2 panels. (contacts panel and events panel)
  * Designed the events panel.
