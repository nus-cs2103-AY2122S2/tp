### Project: CinnamonBun

Small business owners and freelancers may find it difficult to keep track of all their clients.

CinnamonBun is an application that helps to record and manage a large number of clients and business transactions, thus allowing business owners to focus more on their business and less on bookkeeping.

CinnamonBun comes with a beautiful Graphical User Interface (GUI) while still being optimized for control via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

### My Contributions

* **New Feature**: Add ability to undo modifications made to the clients list. [\#80](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/pull/80)
  * Functionality: Allows the user to undo previous modifications made to the clients list in the event they realized they made a mistake.
  * Justification: This feature is necessary as it gives user the ability to undo possible mistakes they have made instead and give them an easy way out to do so. Originally
  if they made a mistake, they would have to try and remember their past command, and try to reverse it manually.

* **New Feature**: Add sorting of clients list. [\#38](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/pull/38)
  * Functionality: Users are able to sort the list by attributes and even chain the sorting order.
  * Justification: Users who need the clients to be in certain orders are now able to obtain the data 
  they need easily, for example they want to obtain the first 10 names in alphabetical order etc.
