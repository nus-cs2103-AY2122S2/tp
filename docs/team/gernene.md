### Project: TAssist

**TAssist** is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants to manage their students across different modules and keep track of students’ activities/participation in class. It is optimized for use via Command Line Interface (CLI). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about X kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to filter entity (module, class group, assessment, student) lists.
  * What it does: Accepts an entity as a filter parameter for list commands. Class groups and assessments can be filtered by a specified module. Students can be filtered by a specified module or class group.
  * Justification: This feature helps users find the information they need more quickly.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands. It required understanding of the way commands interact with models as well as consideration of the system's architecture.

* **New Feature**: Contributed to multi-entity storage.
  * What is does: Allows class groups and assessments to be stored.
  * Contributed to JSON parsing for data storage.
  * Justification: This feature allows TAssist to commit class groups and assessments to persistent storage.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.

* **New Feature**: Added mutliple lists and toggles to GUI.
  * What it does: Allows users to switch between their module, class group, student, and assessment lists by clicking the respective button.
  * Justification: This feature lets users study data more efficiently by leveraging the UI to display information.
  * Highlights: This feature was designed to accomodate more entities if necessary and required a good understanding of FXML and the system's UI architecture.

* **New Feature**: Added attendance panel to GUI.
  * What it does: Adds a "Check Absentees" button to each item in the class group list. Clicking the button opens a panel that lists absentees for each of those class group's lessons.
  * Justification: This feature helps users find information about their classes more quickly. It also gives them a comprehensive visualization of student performance in each class.

* **New Feature**: Added gradebook panel to GUI.
  * What it does: Adds a "See Attempts" button to each item in the assessment list. Clicking the button opens a panel that lists students' attempts that that assessment, particularly the grade they earned.
  * Justification: This feature helps users find information about their classes more quickly. It also gives them a comprehensive visualization of student performance in each class.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=Gernene)

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme/overall styling
  * Wrote additional tests for common classes (ex: ModelManagerTest)
  * Created several entity-builders for testing sample data

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Modified feature list to serve the dual purpose of a step-by-step walkthrough.
    * Reworked UG language to sound more "inviting" and "user-friendly".
  * Developer Guide:
    * Wrote target user profile
    * Contributed heavily to target user stories
    * Added implementation details of the `list` command.
    * Added UML diagrams for the `list` command.

* **Team & Community**:
  * Some PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#106](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/106), [\#99](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/99)
