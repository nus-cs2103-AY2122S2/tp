### Project: RealEstatePro

RealEstatePro is a desktop application for managing your client details for real estate agents. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). With RealEstatePro managing your clients will be a breeze by using the various features such as reminders, client matching and many more!

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implement favourite command.
  * What it does: Allows the user to favourite a client, thus the client appears in a filtered list of favourited clients in another personalized window.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to have a list of clients that the user thinks are potentially always going to be contacted, thus being favourited by him/her. Having another list simplifies the need to remember them and find them through their information (eg. Name).
  * Highlights: This enhancement does not affect existing commands but the existing GUI and user experience. It did require an in-depth analysis of design alternatives as the team decided on how to obtain the list of favourited clients from the existing list.


* **New Feature**: Implement Favourites window command.
  * What it does: Allows the user open up a new window that displays the compacted list of favourited client.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to view the list of clients that the user thinks are potentially always going to be contacted, thus being favourited by him/her.
  * Highlights: This enhancement does not affect existing commands but the existing GUI and user experience.


* **New Feature**: Implement Statistics(window) command.
  * What it does: Allows the user open up a new window that displays the visualization of the data of sellers' properties & buyers' preference based on their region.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to visualize data of his/her client and thus allow him/her to make better business decisions (exp. Find more clients in popular regions).
  * Highlights: This enhancement does not affect existing commands but the existing GUI and user experience.
