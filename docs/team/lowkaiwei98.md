### Project: Trackermon

Trackermon is a desktop application for tracking and managing shows, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Trackermon helps people track and remember what shows they have watched, are currently watching, or plan to watch.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

**Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=lowkaiwei98&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-02-18)

**New Feature**: Added the ability to sort the show list.
* What it does: allows the user to sort the list by name, status, tag, rating and the ability to change the priority of the sort. 
* Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can sort the list and view it in an organised manner. Without this feature, the list might remain a mess, making it less appealing to the user. 

**Project management**:
  * Managed issues relating to Sort, Edit, Clear, etc. [\#118](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/issues/118) [\#103](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/issues/103)
  * Tested for bugs and asked teammates to fix bugs relating to their code. [\#145](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/issues/145)
  * Ensure code quality and standard is met for the project [\#282](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/issues/282) [\#280](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/issues/280)

**Enhancements to existing features**:
