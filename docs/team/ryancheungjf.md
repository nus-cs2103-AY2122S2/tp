### Project: LinkedOUT

LinkedOUT is the only application that any experienced recruiter needs.

LinkedOUT allows recruiters to keep track of many applicants, and the job they applied for. You can store their contact details, skills and the round of their application, all in one place.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

**Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=ryancheungjf&breakdown=true)

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add skills to a particular applicant. (Pull request [\#156](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/156)).
    * What it does: Allows the user to add skills to a particular applicant without using the edit command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because if a user was to use the edit command to add skills, he would have to retype all pre-existing skills.
      Hence, this command provides an alternative by appending the new skills to the pre-existing list, thereby improving user experience.
    * Highlights: Trying to figure out the best Implementation without sacrificing code quality as the command uses functions which are shared between other commands.
    * Credits: Credits to Zhikai for assisting me in thinking of different implementations and weighing their effectiveness.

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * Added functionality to allow search to work with round, an attribute of an applicant. This allows users to work have a better user experience if they wanted to filter based on skills. 
    It also allowed me to work on features with others. (Pull request [\#124](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/124))

  * Created dummy LinkedOUT classes to assist the process of refactoring codebase. This was to prevent the original AB3 from breaking while others were working on their changes. (Pull request [\#43](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/43))
  * Integrated new classes and files from LinkedOUT into AB3's codebase. Allowed me to have the chance to work directly with others as my teammates helped to push to my PR as well. (Pull request [\#57](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/57))
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 69% to 72% (Pull request [\#222](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/222)).
  * Helped to improve test cases to maintain code quality, applying concepts learnt in class of test partitions. (Pull request [\#91](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/91)).

* **Project management**:
    * Helped to handle the creation of milestone v1.4 and creation of team issues. (Issues [\#112](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/issues/112), [\#113](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/issues/113)).

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `addskill`. (Pull request [\#164](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/164)).
        * Helped to maintain formatting and quality. Assisted in making changes based on reviews done in class. (Pull request [\#122](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/122)).
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `addskill` and `view` feature. (Pull requests [\#104](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/104), [\#159](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/159)).
        * Added documentation for manual testing of `addskill` and `delete` command. (Pull request [\#221](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/221)).
        * Helped to refactor pre-existing AB3 PUML files and diagrams. (Pull request [\#96](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/96)).
