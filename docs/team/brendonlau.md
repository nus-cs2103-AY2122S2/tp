### Project: Tinner

Tinner (Anagram of Intern) is a desktop app for managing internship applications, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Tinner allows you to easily sort through and retrieve the relevant information faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=brendonlau&breakdown=true)

* **New Feature**: Added the `editRole` feature to edit a specific role in a company
* What it does: allows the user to edit any fields or remove optional fields in `Role` by specifying the company and role indexes
* Justification: This feature is necessary for the user to update essential fields such as status, set or disable reminder and rectify any mistakes
* Highlight: This change requires a major change in `Model` internal components and additional classes in `Logic` internal components

* **New Feature**: Added the `deleteRole` feature to delete a specific role in a company
* What it does: allows the user to delete a `Role` by specifying the company and role indexes
* Justification: This feature is necessary for the user to delete their internship applications
