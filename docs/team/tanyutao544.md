### Project: SoC InternApply

SoC InternApply - SoC InternApply helps CS students to track internship applications they are interested in. It is optimised for users who prefer CLI and have a lot of company applications and their associated tasks to keep track of. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
