### Project: HireLah

HireLah is a desktop app that helps recruiters to manage talent and job applicants by tracking every step of the hiring process, from offering positions to scheduling interviews with candidates. It is optimised for Command Line Interface (CLI) users while still offering a GUI, so that power users can accomplish tasks much quicker by using commands . It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Tabs in UI
  * New tabs in UI to display the list of `applicants`, `positions` and `interviews`
  * This allows user to view the three lists simultaneously, which makes it easier to reference the indexes


* **New Feature**: Filter feature in `list` command
  * Added new optional parameters to the `list` command to allow filtering of data using different filter criteria
  * This allows user to easily find the data they are looking for
