## Project: Teaching Assistant Contact Helper (TACH)

TACH helps CS Teaching Assistants tutoring multiple modules & classes by keeping
track of their students and monitoring their progress on their tutorials.
It is optimized for CLI users so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing
in commands.

The following sections below summarise my contributions to this project.

* **Code contributed**: **[RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=hqhqhq1&breakdown=true)**
* **New Feature**: Added find tutorial group feature
   * What it does: allows the user to view all students in a particular tutorial group
   * Justification: this feature improves the product significantly because users will need to sort students by tutorial 
  group to have a clear overview of a particular tutorial group, and it also allows users to manage their students by tutorial 
  groups
