### Project: TAssist

**TAssist** is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants to manage their students across different modules and keep track of studentsâ€™ activities/participation in class. It is optimized for use via Command Line Interface (CLI). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 11 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the model for class groups, lessons and student attendances.
  * What it does: Allows the TA to manage the class groups, lessons as well as the students enrolled in the class groups.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a TA needs to manage the class groups he/she is teaching as well as the weekly lessons and student attendances and the app should provide a convenient way to represent them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as changes were made to accommodate the model classes and methods needed for each version iteration (e.g. added `Lesson` and `StudentAttendance` in v1.3).

* **New Feature**: Added the storage for class groups and assessments.
  * What it does: Allows the class groups, assessments as well as the students' attempts to be stored.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because data can be stored and retrieved whenever the TA runs the app.

* **New Feature**: Added parsing for the mark and unmark commands.
  * What it does: Allows the TA to execute the mark and unmark commands by parsing the input.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a TA needs to be able to take student attendances and the app should provide a convenient way to parse and check the TA's input.
  * Highlights: This enhancement required the creation of new methods to accommodate for the parsing of the `s/` prefix (refer below).

* **New Feature**: Added parsing for the `s/` prefix.
  * What it does: Allows the TA to specify the students he/she would like to run the commands on.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a TA needs to be able to specify which students he/she would like to make changes to and the app should provide a convenient way to parse and check the TA's input.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects v1.3 commands (e.g. `mark`, `unmark`). It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as various inputs need to be handled with the appropriate error messages.

* **New Feature**:
  * Wrote tests for the `ClassGroup`, `Lesson` and `StudentAttendance` components as well as their relative storage classes `JsonAdaptedClassGroup`, `JsonAdaptedLesson` and `JsonAdaptedStudentAttendance`.
  * Wrote tests for the `DeleteCommand` and `DeleteCommandParser`.
