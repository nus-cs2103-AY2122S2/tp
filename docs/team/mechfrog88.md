### Project: iBook

IBook is an inventory recording system for storekeepers to manage incoming and outgoing products in a store.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Popup window
  * What it does: Allow users to interact with GUI interface for trivial commands (Add/Update/Delete) for (Product/Item).
  * Justification: Users do not have to remember the syntax for trivial commands.

* **New Feature**: Discount Feature
  * What it does: Allow users to view the discount price for expiring items.
  * Justification: Users can sell expiring items at a much faster rate. This will reduce wastage and boost sales.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=mechfrog88&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Improved the application's UI/UX
  * Improved UI design with inspiration from [Warehouse Management System](https://dribbble.com/shots/16271310-Warehouse-Management-System) by Ashkan Fazeli.
  * Restructured UI component to better fit iBook's requirement.
  * Created most of the CSS and FXML files for UI.
  * Added icons from [Feather](https://feathericons.com/) to better indicate the behaviour of the buttons.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Uploaded interface's screenshot (main window/popup/button).
    * Restructured the user guide.
    * Reduced inconsistency in the user guide by creating a fixed format to describe the features.
    * Fixed grammar issues in the user guide.
    * Added questions related to macOS in the FAQ.
    * Optimized the user guide for pdf.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Created UML diagrams for the UI component (structure/table/popup/control).
    * Gave a high-level overview of the UI component.
    * Described the implementation of Popup Window with sequence diagram.

* **Community**:
