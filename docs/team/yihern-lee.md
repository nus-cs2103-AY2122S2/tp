### Project: HireLah

HireLah is a desktop app that helps recruiters to manage talent and job candidates by tracking every step of the hiring process, from offering positions to scheduling interviews with candidates. It is optimised for Command Line Interface (CLI) users while still offering a GUI, so that power users can accomplish tasks much quicker by using commands . It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

### Summary of Contributions:
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Position
    * New Position data type to represent a position in the company that is open for hire.
    * Position tracks the number of openings, as well as, the number of offers handed out the applicants.
    * Position contains other fields, such as, description and requirement tags, to allow recruiters to associate information with the position.
    * Other notable contributions to support this feature:
      * Parsers to support `add`, `delete` and `edit` commands for Positions.
      * Command logic for executing `add`, `delete` and `edit`.
      * Methods in `Model` to support the cascading effects for editing a Position.
      * Unit tests to cover the input validation for `PositionName`, `PositionOpenings`, `Description` and `Requirement`.
      * Unit tests to cover the execution correctness for `AddPositionCommand`, `DeletePositionCommand`, `EditPositionCommand` and their various parsers.
