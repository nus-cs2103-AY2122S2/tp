### Project: TAlent Assistant™

### Overview ###
TAlent Assistant™ is a desktop lightweight and centralized management system catered to professors for managing the
process of hiring undergraduate/graduate Teaching Assistants (TA). They will be able to access the TAs’ application
data easily and review qualifications or availability for scheduling interviews. It is optimized for use via a Command
Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, this
application will be able to help you manage all things under the hood of the TA initiative faster than traditional
GUI applications.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `InterviewStatus` [#87](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/pull/87)
  * Created a new attribute for the `Candidate` for the user to tag.
  * Justification: This will enable the user to be able to see clearly which `Candidates` have not been scheduled.
  * Highlights: Created triggers for the `InterviewStatus` to be toggled automatically.
  * Worked with other team members to allow `InterviewStatus` to be toggled according to the `Scheduling` system in the Application. 

* **New Feature**: `ApplicationStatus` [#87](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/pull/87)
  * Created a new attribute for the `Candidate` for the user to tag.
  * Justification: This will enable the user to tag the `Candidate` according to their Application outcome. 
  * Worked with other team members to ensure the statuses integrate well with the `Scheduling` system. 

* **New Feature**: `focus command` [#180](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/pull/180)
  * Created a new feature to allow a `Candidate's` information to be populated in the center panel. 
  * Justification: Remove clutter in the `main list`, and only retrieve `Candidate's` information when necessary.
  * Highlights: Enabled the center panel to refresh when the `Candidate's` `interview` or `statuses` is edited
