### Project: HustleBook

HustleBook is a desktop app specially catered towards financial advisors for **managing client details** and **scheduling meetings efficiently** without the need to lift their hands off the keyboard.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

This project is built on top of the **AB3** application that is used for teaching Software Engineering principles.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to flag clients via flag/unflag commands.
    * What it does: allows the user to flag important clients. Clients can be flagged or unflagged via the flag/unflag commanf respectively. 
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can not specify and view important clients who have benn flagged previously. 
    * Highlights: This enhancement serves as the basis for a few other features such as listing flagged or unflagged clients only. 
    * Credits: *This implementation is loosely based on AB3â€™s implementation of a person's attributes*

* **New Feature**: Added a flag field for client.
