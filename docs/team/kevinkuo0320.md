### Project: Tracey

Tracey is a desktop app for managing health statuses of NUS Hall Residents. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to import an Excel file to the Tracey database.
  * What it does: This allows the user to import an Excel file that contains the Covid information of students into Tracey database directly.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to quickly import multiple entries of student records from an Excel file. The user do not require to
    add each entry one by one.
  * Highlights: The user just need to specify the Excel's file path in the command line, the file type and data format will be checked. In other words,
    the user do not to worry to import wrong type of files or incorrect formats of data entries.

* **New Feature**: Added an import button for the import feature
  * What it does: This allows the user to import an Excel file by pressing the import button.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to use the import feature without typing the command. The user
    can simply press the button, and choose the importing file from the file explorer window.
  * Highlights: The button is implemented for both Window and Mac users, and it is automatically pop up the
    file explorer for the user to choose the importing file.
