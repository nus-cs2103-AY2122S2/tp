### Project: Tracey

Tracey is a desktop app for managing health statuses of NUS students by administrative staffs, optimized for use via a CLI while still having the benefits of a GUI. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Add entry**: Added the ability to edit an entry.
    * What it does: allows the user to edit the details of a student.
    * Justification: This feature is fundamental to the product because a user can edit the details of an existing student.
    * Highlights: This enhancement increases the ease of editing entries. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
    * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added an edit command that allows the user to edit previous records by indicating the student index.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
        * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
    * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
    * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo
