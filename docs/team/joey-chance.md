# Overview
MedBook is a **desktop app health monitoring system for healthcare professionals** that simplifies tracking patient’s medical information and hospital records via a Command Line Interface (CLI). MedBook delivers a seamless workflow for doctors and healthcare professionals to search for or update patients' emergency contacts, medical information, medical tests, consultations and prescriptions through a simple and easy-to-use platform.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Patient’s Medical Test Results
  * What it does: It allows the user to add the results of medical tests taken by a patient to the corresponding patient’s records
  * Justification: This features extend the product functionality as a health monitoring system to store patients’ medical test results. Medical professionals can monitor a patient’s health condition or progress through the results of the medical test taken.
  * Credits: The feature was built on top of [AddressBook Level 3 (AB3)](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3). Some parts of the codes were adapted and modified.

* **New Feature**: Finding Records Containing Keyword(s)
  * What it does: It filters the list of records currently displayed to the user to show those matching any of the keywords specified by the user.
  * Justification: Medical professionals want to quickly find relevant information pertaining to the patient through the use of keywords.
