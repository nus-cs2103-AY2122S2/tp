## Project: TeachWhat!
TeachWhat! is a desktop address book application used for private tutors in managing their class. The user interacts
with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### New features implemented
1. Implemented an InfoPanel that can view Lesson or Student details.
   (Pull request [#63](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/63))
   - What it does: Allows the user to view more detailed information about a Lesson or Student.
   - Justification: As more fields are added to both Lessons and Students, having a dedicated section in the UI to view 
   more detailed information is needed.
   - Reorganized the bottom half of the UI with two sections, split using a slider.
   - Designed new InfoPanel for both Lesson and Student
2. Added `lesson` and `student` view commands to view the details of a Lesson or Student in the InfoPanel.
   (Pull request [#62](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/62))
   - This is an extension of the InfoPanel feature
   - What it does: Allows users to specify which Lesson or Student they want to view using the index on the displayed 
   list.
3. Implemented a user input history function (Pull request 
[#150](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/150))
   - What it does: Allows users to view previously entered commands using the arrow keys
   - Justification: Since CLIs have command history as a basic feature, adding it to TeachWhat not only improves user
   experience but is also fitting as we are trying to target CLI users.
   - Highlights: Retyping an entire command can be troublesome, especially when executing something similar. This
   enhancement would allow someone to easily refer to and edit their previously entered command.
