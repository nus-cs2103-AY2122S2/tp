### Project: MedBook

MedBook is a **desktop app health monitoring system for healthcare professionals** that simplifies tracking patient’s medical information and hospital records via a Command Line Interface (CLI). MedBook delivers a seamless workflow for doctors and healthcare professionals to search for or update patients' emergency contacts, medical information, medical tests, consultations and prescriptions through a simple and easy-to-use platform.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Patient's Medical Prescription

It allows user to add medical prescription information to the patients. This feature
extends the product functionality by allowing medical professionals to keep track of
patients' medical prescription records. This feature was built on top of [AddressBook Level 3 (AB3)](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3).



* **New Feature**: Command History Navigation

It enhances the user experience by allowing users to navigate through the command
history by pressing the `↑` and `↓` arrow keys.
