### Project: HackNet

HackNet helps computing students find teammates to do projects with. It allows users to add and find contacts by technical skills, providing them a platform to find the right teammates for each project.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * [Filter contacts for past teammates: `filterteam`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/52)
    * **What it does**: This new feature allows user to filter the contacts in HackNet that the user has tagged as a
      teammate before, through the use of the `add` or `edit` commands.
    * **Justification**: This feature allows user to easily find teammates that they have worked with before. This is
      helpful when the user wishes to look up someone they have previously worked with before.
    * **Highlights**: This feature was built off the original `list` command from AB3. The name of the command was
      thought to be unintuitive and too long, the name was left as it is in the end to prevent confusion.


* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=melvinczj&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-02-18&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=tzhan98&tabRepo=AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)


* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Enhanced the user input experience by allowing users to navigate their input history for the
    current session using the `↑` and `↓` keys.


* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for [`filterteam`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/52) and [feature to navigate user input history](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/69)


* **Community**:
  * PR reviewed: [#77](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/77)
