### Project: Nus Classes

NUS Classes is an app that enables the professors to better manage contacts from large numbers of students and staff, and allow the professor to document the task that he/she needs to do.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: View Task (Pull Request [\#68](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/68))
    * What it does: Allows user to view who were assigned to each task.
    * Justification: This allows NUS Computing Professors to easily remember who they assigned to the task.
    * Highlights: Understanding how `ObservableList` works and the effect it has on the GUI.
    * Credits: *Reused code ideas from AB3*
<br><br>
* **New Feature**: Storing link in tasks (Pull Request [\#95](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/95))
  * What it does: Stores link in tasks.
  * Justification: This allows NUS Computing Professors to store link to task for easier management.
<br><br>

* **New Feature**: Create recurring tasks (Pull Request [\#114](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/114))
    * What it does: Allows user to create a task repeatedly with a fixed interval using a single command.
    * Justification: This allows NUS Computing Professors to create tasks that occur regularly conveniently.
    * Credits: [baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-initialize-hashmap) *for the mapping of common date intervals. Reused with slight modifications*
<br><br>
* **New Feature**: List tasks (Pull Request [\#146](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/146))
    * What it does: List all tasks.
    * Justification: This allows NUS Computing Professors to see all the tasks they created, after they have manipulated the list.
    * Credits: *Reused some code ideas from AB3 to suit Task*
<br><br>
* **New Feature**: Highlighting of tasks (Pull Request [\#149](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/149))
    * What it does: Highlight tasks with different colour depending on their state.
    * Justification: This allows NUS Computing Professors to easily see which tasks are coming up or are already dued.
