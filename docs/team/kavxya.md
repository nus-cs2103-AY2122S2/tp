### Project: uMessage

**Overview**

uMessage is an app that helps university students manage their **contacts** and **meetings**.
It is optimized for keyboard users.

This project is part of the [CS2103T](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/website/) team project requirements for AY2021/2022 Semester 2.


**Summary of Contributions**

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added `copy` command to the Contacts tab.
    * What it does: allows the user to copy details of an individual contact using CLI commands.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is able to copy information quickly and with ease.
    * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as it requires an in-depth analysis of how commands interact and are displayed in order to come up with the most suited implementation.
