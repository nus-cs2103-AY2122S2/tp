### Project: iBook

IBook is an inventory recording system for storekeepers to manage incoming and outgoing products in a store.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=mazx4960&breakdown=true)

<br>

* **New Feature**: Add/ Delete product command ([#32](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/pull/32), [#37](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/pull/37))
  * What it does: Allows the user to add/ delete a new product to iBook.
  * Justification: Provides an easy way to track all the products that the shopkeeper has in the store.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to have multiple items for a product ([#44](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/pull/44))
  * What it does: Allows the user to add items to a product.
  * Justification: Different items might have different expiry dates. This allows the user to keep track of these items separately in an organised manner.

* **New Feature**: Display product filters ([#105](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/pull/105))
  * What it does: Allows the user to filter the products based on different parameters like their name, category etc, and display the current applied filter in the user interface.
  * Justification: The storekeeper might have a lot of items in the application, this filter allows him to find products that he is looking for and display it in the user interface.

<br>

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Find Command ([#128](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/pull/128))
  * What it does: Allows a more general search of the products, by allowing partial matching of the name or category as well as finding a range of prices.
  * Justification: The storekeeper might not remember the exact name of the product that he is looking for, and this provides a convenient way for him to do so.
