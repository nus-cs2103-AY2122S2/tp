### Project: ManageEZPZ

ManageEZPZ is a desktop application that allows managers or supervisors to manage employees and assign tasks to them. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * **Edit Task** ([#122](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/pull/122))
    * User is able to freely edit different kind of tasks (Todo, Deadline, Event)
    * For example, a user can just edit the description of a Deadline task 
      or update both description and date at the same time.
  * **Add Task (Deadline, Event)** ([#73](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/pull/73))
    * User is able to add Deadline and Event task to their list.
