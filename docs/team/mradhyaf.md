### Project: InternBuddy

InternBuddy is a desktop app that helps undergraduate students keep track of the companies they've
applied to for internships as well as any events you've arranged with them. It is optimized for
CLI users who prefer to type commands for efficiency.

InternBuddy is specialised for fast-typing users which is the main feature of the application. Efficiency and ease of use are two of InternBuddy's principle when
designing the application. It provides a lot of functionalities catered specifically for those looking for internships
which come from a real conducted survey.
