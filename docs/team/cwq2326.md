### Project: Tracey
Tracey is a desktop app for managing health statuses of NUS Hall Residents. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability archive the database [\#112](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/112) [\#121](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/121)
  * What it does: This allows the user to save a copy of the current working database. The archived file will be saved in a separate directory ordered by date for easy retrieval.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to safely preserve the current working database, which might be valuable to any party of interest or kept for future reference.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to resize the result display window via the command line interface or toggling the button [\#145](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/145) [\#275](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/275)
  * What it does: This allows the user to resize the result display window according to three pre-set size.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to resize the result display window to their preference, and is especially useful if the user's application window size is small or for commands that return long result display text.

* **New Feature**: Added the initial implementation of the pie chart window for the summarise feature [\#81](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/81) [\#85](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/85)
  * What it does: The pie chart window will show an overview of the covid statuses of NUS hall residence from different hall blocks and faculties.
  * Justification: This feature provides the user an easy way to obtain an overview analysis of the covid status of residence residing in his/her hall with just a single command.
