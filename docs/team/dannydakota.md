### Project: Tracey

Tracey is a desktop app for managing health statuses of NUS Hall Residents. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * Added the ability to copy email from the Tracey database.
      * What it does: allows the user to use the `email` command or click on the `Show Email` button to open a Window containing the list of emails Tracey database. After which, the administrator can click on the copy email button to copy this set of emails to their clipboard.
      * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because an administrator might want to contact these set of students via email and can do so easily by clicking on the copy email button. They can then proceed to their email domain of choice and easily paste this into the recipient address box.
      * Highlights: This enhancement addresses user story #15. This enhancement introduces a new Stackpane component UI to be used for further features such as Resize Display and Import.
