### Project: ContaX

ContaX is an integrated solution designed for busy professionals who work with many clients and frequently interact with other people. It assists those who have packed schedules in efficiently scheduling appointments, while also being able to respond to volatile changing schedules. 
 
ContaX allows efficient management of a large list of contacts together with a schedule, providing an integrated solution for tracking work-related information. Built with efficiency in mind, ContaX promises a seamless transition from existing solutions for minimal downtime.
