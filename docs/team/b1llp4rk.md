### Project: HackNet

HackNet - HackNet is a desktop address book application used for finding teammates to do team projects with. It interacts the user using a CLI, and has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is a product of brownfield project of turning [AB3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) into an addressbook program targeted to computer science students trying to form a project team.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=b1llp4rk&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-02-18&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Enable editing multiple persons with `edit` command
        * **What it does:** This feature allows user to edit multiple persons in HackNet at once, for teams and skills fields.
        * **Justification:** A student who uses HackNet might need to edit multiple persons. For example, the student might have learned about a team project that 5 of his friends are working on. After adding friends that were not present in the HackNet data, the student would prefer one command to `edit` the team info for all five of them, instead of having to type the `edit` command five times for each persons.
        * **Highlights:** [`batchedit`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/79) command was created initially to enable editing multiple persons. However later the command and its features were [assimilated to `edit` command](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/84). The decision was made as an attempt to minimize the types of commands that user has to learn.

    * Establish reset and [default mode](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/82)
        * **What it does:** Either reset or default mode can be chosen by the user when using the `edit` command. In the reset mode, the teams and skills values that the user provides as parameter of `edit` completely replaces the previous values for teams and skills of the person(s) that the user is editing. In default mode, the teams and skills values that the user provides gets appended to the pre-existing teams and skills of the person(s) being edited.
        * **Justification:** Before establishing the two modes, the only behaviour of `edit` was equal to the reset mode. Assume a case where a user has a person in the HackNet data that has multiple skills, and wants to add one more skill to the person. In that case, the user has to type all the skills that the person data had in HackNet again, only to add just one more skill. Establishing another behaviour defined to be default mode now allows user to pass in only the new skill as the parameter for `edit`.
        * **Highlights:** Reset mode is activated only when the user deliberately indicates `r` option. Otherwise `edit` command operates in default mode. This design decision was based on the ideas that default mode would be used more often to add a new skill or team of a person, and often used feature must be short to type. The two modes exist both when editing multiple persons and only one person.

    * Enable comma separation of multiple values for teams and skills
        * **What it does:** The user can use a comma to separate multiple values of teams or skills, for `add` and `edit` command.
        * **Justification:** The previous design of passing in multiple values of teams and skills required user to prefix each value with `t/` or `s/`. Using a comma is easier, especially when passing a large number of teams or skills. This feature was first implemented on [`edit`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/79) command, and was later added to [`add`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/87) command.
      
* **Bug Fixes**
    * [Fixed `edit`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/143) to ignore fields other than teams and skills when editing multiple persons in batch, as UserGuide states. This prevents such case when the user tries to edit multiple persons in HackNet to have the same phone number, which is likely to be invalid.
    * Inability to redo some edit commands was discovered while [reinforcing integration test of edit command](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/issues/156), and was fixed.
        * Commands that alter the data of HackNet have to commit the changed data, and this step was omitted for `edit` commands that modify multiple persons at once.
    * [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/issues/196) that valid team names do not get accepted.

* **Contributions to the UG**:
    * Updated section of `edit` command on how to edit multiple persons, and using the reset and default mode.
    * Updated sections of `edit` and `add` command on the use of commas to separate multiple values.

* **Contributions to the DG**:
    * [Added](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/178) Class diagram for EditCommand and Sequence diagram for `add` command.
    * [Updated](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/175) AB3 diagrams including 'delete' sequence diagram and `Model` component's class diagrams.

* **Contributions to the team-based tasks**:
    * Took demo screenshots of v1.2 features
    * Polished the UserGuide and converting to pdf in v1.2
    * [Adapted user guide of AB3](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/37), the software that HackNet diverged off, to suite HackNet
    * [Adapted developer guide of](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/27) AB3 to suit HackNet

* **Review/mentoring contributions**:
    * PRs reviewed [Add team forming functionality](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/55), [Branch feature undo redo](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/76)
    * Created [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o6p2SsmEs_IymRg4lEkOU_lBn1cOKKRQ4SA5hR088cA/edit#gid=0) to manage even spread of PR review work within teammates.

* **Contributions beyond the project team**:
    * Posted a [tip](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S2/forum/issues/129) on customizing Intellij to follow common git convention on the forum.
