### Project: MyGM

MyGM is a desktop app for high school basketball team trainers to manage players’ contacts and data, optimized for use
via a Command Line Interface (CLI). The user will interact with using a CLI and has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added `Theme` command to allow user to change between light and dark mode.
  * What it does: Allows users change between light and dark mode.
  * Justification: This feature will reduce stress on the user's eyes and allow the user to view the app based on their preferences.
  * Highlights: It required an in-depth understanding of the front end components.

* **New Feature**: Added `Lineup` and `Schedule` packages with the relevant classes.
