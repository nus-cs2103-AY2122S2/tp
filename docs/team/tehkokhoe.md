### Project: d'Intérieur
d'Intérieur is a desktop app for interior designers to manage their contacts and projects. The designer interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 26 kLoC.

Interior designers can use d'Intérieur to improve contact management and take on the needs of an ever-growing client base, so that they can focus on what matters most - delivering quality service for clients.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add deadlines to contact.
  * Justification: This feature is essential because interior designer can keep track of project deadlines.
  * Highlights: This enhancement involves the Logic, Model and UI objects, which require a good understanding in how these objects interact with  each other.
  * Credits: Adding deadlines and removing deadlines without refreshing
    the list of deadlines was implemented by Wei Jue.

* **New Feature**: Added a sort command.
  * Justification: This feature is essential as contact list grows larger, it is essential for interior designers to find top contacts based on a certain criteria.
  * Highlights: This enhancement involves implementing multiple
    Comparators for the different models, it also involved some changes to 
    UI to display a sorted list.
