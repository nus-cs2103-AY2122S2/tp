### Project: WoofAreYou

WoofAreYou is a desktop app for pet daycare owners to handle the administrative information of their pets. If you can type fast, WoofAreYou can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
1. **Appointment Command** [#74](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/pull/74) [#82](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/pull/82)
  * What it does:
    * Allows the user to store appointment information of pets.
    * Appointment information consists of date of appointment, time of appointment and location of appointment.
  * Justification:
    * This feature enables the user to track the pet appointments and ensure that user do not overlook or forget any appointment of the pets.
  * Credits:
    * This feature was extended and refined from the RemarkCommand tutorial that was done at the start of the tP iteration.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
1. `Second level Project refactoring` [#62](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/pull/62):
  * Worked on second level refactoring to convert project from address book to woofareyou.

2. `Update SortCommand` [#89](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/pull/89) [#99](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/pull/99):
  * Changed the Sort Command format to be more user-friendly.
  * Implemented Sort functionality for 3 additional fields: "app", "pickup time" and "dropoff time".

3. `Update GUI for Appointment` [#109](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/pull/109):
  * Initially appointment title label reflected the color of the appointment status while the appointment information had no color label.
  * Updated appointment title label to be one singular color label while appointment info status label had a color coding reflecting the status of the appointment. eg. `Red` represent appointment is over, `Green` represent appointment is today and `Grey` represent appointment is in the future.<br/>
4. `Update GUI filtered list display` [#158](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/pull/158):
  * Initially GUI display of filtered list formed by `find` and `filter` commands will prematurely refactor to display full unfiltered pet list when any command was executed.
  * Refined GUI filtered list behaviour to retain the filtered list display to improve user experience.
