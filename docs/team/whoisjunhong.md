### Project: Ultimate Divoc Tracker

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the SE-EDU initiative. This application is a variation of the above original project, tailored for school administrators to track COVID-19 cases amongst students in schools.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Status attribute for Person -- (Pull Request [\#37](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/37))
  * What it does: Gives each person in the list a class code attribute denoting class number/code.
