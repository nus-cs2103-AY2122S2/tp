### Project: Ultimate Divoc Tracker

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the SE-EDU initiative.

This application is a variation of the above original project, tailored for school administrators to automate the tracking COVID-19 cases amongst students in schools.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=whoisjunhong&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)


* **New Feature**: Batch Update Status based on Class Code -- (Pull request:[\#70](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/70))
  * What it does:
    * Upon a positive case in the ClassCode, all student's status in that ClassCode will be updated to Close-Contact
    * If no positive cases in the ClassCode, all student's status in that ClassCode wil be updated back to Negative
  * Justification: Track and automate COVID-19 close contact using class code
  * Credits: *{Collaborators: Jun Hong, Joshua, Louis}*

* **New Feature**: Add ClassCode methods -- (Pull request: [\#37](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/37))
  * What it does: Gives each person in the list a class code attribute denoting class number/code
  * Justification: Track COVID-19 close contact using class code

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Repurpose tags to activities (Pull requests [\#77](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/77))
    * What it does: Person can have multiple activities (e.g. CCA, functional groups)
    * Justification: Track COVID-19 close contact using activities
  * Enhancement to UI (Pull request [\#116](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/116))
    * What it does: Enhancement to current AB3 UI to make it more UI/UX centric
    * Justification: To beautify the application and allow the user to have a more pleasant experience using the application instead of the default theme provided by AB3
    
* **Fixes**: 
  * Fix batch update status for `AddCommand` and `DeleteCommand`  -- (Pull request: [\#118](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/118))
    * What it fixes:
      * Edge Case 1: If user is added into application who is `Positive`, the students in the same ClassCode and Activity does not change to `Close-Contact`
      * Edge Case 2: If user is deleted from the application who is `Positive` and the ClassCode and/or Activity does not have any other positive cases, those students statuses does not change to `Negative`
      * Edge Case 3: If user is added into application who is `Negative` while the ClassCode and/or Activity is `Close-Contact`, those students statuses does not change to `Negative`
      * Edge Case 4: If user is added into application who is `Negative` while there is still a `Positive` case in the ClassCode and/or Activity, the recently added student status will be changed to `Close-Contact`
    * Justification: Fix edge cases which will snowball into other critical bugs in the future
  * Fix UI and UG -- (Pull request: [\#193](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/193))
