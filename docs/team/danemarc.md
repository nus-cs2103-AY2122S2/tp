### Project: CinnamonBun

Small business owners and freelancers may find it difficult to keep track of all their clients.

CinnamonBun is an application that helps to record and manage a large number of clients and business transactions, thus allowing business owners to focus more on their business and less on bookkeeping.

CinnamonBun comes with a beautiful Graphical User Interface (GUI) while still being optimized for control via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
