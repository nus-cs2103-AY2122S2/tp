### Project: MedBook

MedBook is a **desktop app health monitoring system for healthcare professionals** that simplifies tracking patientâ€™s medical information and hospital records via a Command Line Interface (CLI). MedBook delivers a seamless workflow for doctors and healthcare professionals to search for or update patients' emergency contacts, medical information, medical tests, consultations and prescriptions through a simple and easy-to-use platform.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Patient's Emergency Contact
  * What it does: It allows the user to add emergency contacts to the patient.
  * Justification: This features extend the product functionality as a health monitoring system to store patients' emergency contacts. Medical professionals can contact patients' next-of-kin via their emergency contact list.
  * Credits: The feature was built on top of [AddressBook Level 3 (AB3)](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3). Some part of the codes were adapted and modified.

* **New Feature**: Authentication and Encryption
  * What it does: It secures the product with a authentication system and encrypts data files with a user password. Medical professionals need to setup a password and authenticate to the product.
  * Justification: Medical professionals want to handle sensitive personal information of their patients. The authentication and encryption system offers a layer of security to protect against unauthorised users.
  * Highlights: This feature leverages an encryption algorithm: AES-256.
  * Credits: The code design was inspired by [Encrypting and Decrypting Files in Java](https://www.baeldung.com/java-cipher-input-output-stream).

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=clement0010&breakdown=true)
