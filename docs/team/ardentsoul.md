### Project: Trackermon

Trackermon is a desktop application for tracking and managing shows, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Trackermon helps people track and remember what shows they have watched, are currently watching, or plan to watch.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=ardentsoul&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-02-18)

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Added the ability to search through specific parameters in a show through the `find` command. ([\#134](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/pull/134), [\#176](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/pull/176))
  * What it does: Allows the user to find and filter through shows with a greater degree of precision.
  * Justification: The ability to easily search for shows in a wide list of shows is vital because it saves time and reduces confusion for the user.
  * Highlights: Allows users to select the field they want to search across the list, as well as combine the specifications for a more tailored search.
  * Credits: The find feature was adopted from imPoster created by team [AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp), [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24553761/how-to-apply-multiple-predicates-to-a-java-util-stream) and [AB-3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3).

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Improved on the help window and its UI. ([\#132](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/pull/132), [\#191](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/pull/191))
  * What it does: Allows the user to quickly see the command summary table without accessing the user guide.
  * Justification: The ability to quickly search up the commands in the help window creates less hassle for the user. Otherwise, the user has to read up the user guide to know what commands are available in Trackermon.
  * Highlights: Allows users to see a table of commands that summarizes all available commands in Trackermon and use them quickly without accessing the user guide.
  * Credits: The help window feature was adopted from the video [here](https://youtu.be/vego72w5kPU).
