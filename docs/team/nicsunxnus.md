## 2. Introduction
...
### 2.2 Interface Guide
Reache uses **two windows**, the [Main Window](#221-main-window) and the 
[Contact Details Window](#222-contact-details-window) as a means of maintaning **information segregation**. 
The `Main Window` displays only the `names` and `tags` which is our predetermined basic requirement for 
contact identification, while the `Contact Details Window` displays the more detailed information inside a 
specific contact. You could imagine this layout as **resembling looking through a folder with small identification 
tags sticking out and only pulling out the document with the tag when you want to view its details**. This would help 
to save space on the main window as well as preventing information overload.

```markdown
### 5.2 Edit feature
The edit mechanism is a feature used to change the details of a contact. It is only accessible from the Contact Details Page, and so must be preceded by an _add_ or _view_ command, both of which navigate the user to the Contact Details Page. It is facilitated mainly by the `ContactDetailsPageParser`, `EditCommandParser` and `EditCommand` classes.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:

![EditCommandSequenceDiagram](images/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
- Here, the user executes an `EditCommand`, and supplies the argument `n/Jack`, meaning they wish to change the name of `personToEdit` to "Jack".


![DetailedParsingForEditSequenceDiagram](images/DetailedParsingForEditSequenceDiagram.png)


Below is an activity diagram summarising the possible paths leading to and during the execution of an `EditCommand`:

![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Similar to adding a contact, the contact edited cannot have the same **Name** and **Tags** as an existing contact in the addressbook. This is meant to protect against duplicate contacts which may result in confusion for the user in managing their contacts. Attempting to do so will result in a warning message to the user which reads "A person with these details already exists. Please do add tags that differentiate between them!"

</div>

#### 5.2.1 Design considerations:

**Aspect: How edit saves:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each edit is saved immediately.
    * Pros: Prevents data loss from system crashes.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2 :** All edits are saved only after executing a save command (not implemented feature).
    * Pros: Allows user to revert their changes
    * Cons: System crashes will not save the edits.
