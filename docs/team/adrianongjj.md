### Project: NUSClasses

NUS Classes is an app that enables the professors to better manage contacts from large numbers of students and staff, and allow the professor to document the task that he/she needs to do.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Finding tasks by date and/or time
  * What it does: Find all tasks that are in between the given date time range
  * Justification: Users can check their availability within a certain time frame
  * Highlights: 
    * Uses same command as `findt` so the user can have 1 less command to remember
    * Input order for date time search is not required, i.e. `findt dt/19-03-2022 1000, 19-03-2022 1200` is the same as `findt dt/19-03-2022 1200, 19-03-2022 1000`
  * **Credits:** *Reused some functionalities from the existing AB3 to suit Task*
