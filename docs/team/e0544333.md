### Project: Ultimate Divoc Tracker
Ultimate Divoc Tracker is a desktop app for managing COVID-19 contacts in school admin, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Ultimate DivocTracker can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to perform Batch student Status update [\#62](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/62)
  * What it does: allows administrators to quickly update students who was in close-contact with a COVID-19 positive student by class/co-curricular activity.
  * Justification: this feature improves the product significantly because it removes the need for repetitive manual change of statuses.
  * Highlights: This enhancement leverages on the editCommand that was implemented by the AddressBook. Moreover, it was a challenge to add a layer to the edit process.

* **Unit Test**: Fixed code-breaking test cases after introducing new attributes to `Person` [\#62](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/62)
  * What it does: allows test cases to pass with the addition of new Class attributes, and cater to a wider spectrum of edge cases.
  * Justification: this allows more test cases to be generated for stress testing the product.
  * Highlights: This amendment replies on various Class attributes from the Person class.

* **New Attribute** Created `ClassCode` attribute
  * What it does: caters for an important element of contact tracing in schools, allowing administrators to categorize students by ClassCode.
  * Justification: this attribute provides an additional layer of filtering for administrators.
