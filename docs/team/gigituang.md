### Project: McKitchen

McKitchen (My-CLI-Kitchen) is a desktop application that can quickly store, edit, and search for recipes by running a single command, ideal for the fast typists, home cooks, and students who want a simple way to store or search for simple recipes to cook. The user interacts with it using a CLI-like interface, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has about 8 kLoC.

Listed below are my contributions to the project with majority of the credits given to AB-3 as it served as a strong foundation for our application.

* **New Feature**: Added a `Delete` command (Pull requests [\#61](),[\#75]())
  * What it does: Allows the user to delete recipes either by the recipe name or its index
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can quickly remove any unwanted recipes in the application.
  * Wrote test cases for `Delete` command and `DeleteCommandParser` to ensure that it meets 100% code coverage [\#128](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/128)

* **Project management**:
  * Sorted out issues found by other students and assigned them accordingly based on type and severity
  * Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4rc` (3 releases) on GitHub


* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Wrote `CommandTestUtil` for testing of different commands [\#106](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/106)
  * Wrote test cases for `ingredients` to ensure that 100% code coverage is met (Pull requests [\#131](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/131), [\#132](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/132))
  * Wrote test cases for `Exit` Command [\#106](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/106)
