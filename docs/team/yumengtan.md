### Project: NUScheduler
NUScheduler is a desktop app for Year 1 Computing students to assist with more efficient management of tasks and contacts,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, NUScheduler can schedule your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `FindTask` command. (Pull Requests [#33](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-4/tp/pull/33), [#59](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-4/tp/pull/59), [#84](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-4/tp/pull/84))
    * What it does: Allow the user to find matching tasks in task list based on a keyword or multiple keywords
    * Justification: Our target audience is year 1 computing students. It helps them easily find any tasks such as assignments based on a keyword or multiple keywords.
    * **Classes created**:
    * `FindTaskCommand`
    * `FindTaskCommandParser`
    * **Tests Written**:
      * `FindTaskCommandTest`
      * `FindTaskCommandParserTest`
    * **Additional info**:
      * Used regex to filter task list.
      * Credits: The regex method to implement `FindTask` feature was referenced and adapted from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25483114/regex-to-find-whole-word-in-text-but-case-insensitive).
