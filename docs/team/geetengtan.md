### Project: TAddressBook

Below are my contributions to the project:

- **New Feature:** Filter Students by labs [#70](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F10-1/tp/pull/70) & [#94](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F10-1/tp/pull/94)
    - What it does:
      - Filters the student list by their `labNumber` and `labStatus`. `StudentHasLabPredicate` is utilised to filter
        the `filteredStudentList`.
    - Justification:
      - The TAddressBook might have large amounts of students and the TA will want a more concise list of students
        with specific commonalities.
    - Highlights:
      - This feature involved introducing a `Predicate` in a javafx `FilteredList`.
      - Added functionalities for `LabStatus` to support current features.

- **New Feature:** View Student Details [#90](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F10-1/tp/pull/90)
  - What it does:
    - Previews a student's details in another pop up window. Hidden details such as `labMark` are shown here.
  - Justification:
    - TA might want to examine a student's lab performance.
  - Highlights:
    - This feature is UI intensive. The css and fxml of the `ViewWindow` also made use of the `LabLabel` to create a
      better looking list of labs in the `ViewWindow` with dynamic colours.
