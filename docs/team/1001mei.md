### Project: Ibook

IBook is an inventory recording system for storekeepers to manage incoming and outgoing products in a store.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Update-all feature
  * What it does: Allow user to update details of multiple products in one command
  * Justification: User does not need to update detail for each product one by one when the detail to update is same

* **New Feature**: Undo/redo feature
  * What it does: Allow user to undo or redo recent changes made
  * Justification: User no longer need to worry about accidentally updating or deleting data, as these actions can be easily undone

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=1001mei&breakdown=true)

* **Project management**:
  * Manage releases `v1.2.1` - `v1.3` (2 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Added more test codes to increase robustness of application

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
      * Added documentations for update-related commands
      * Added documentations for undo/redo commands
    * Developer Guide:
