### Project: LinkedOUT

LinkedOUT is the only application that any experienced recruiter needs.

LinkedOUT allows recruiters to keep track of many applicants, and the job they applied for. You can store their contact details, skills and the round of their application, all in one place.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=kaiyichen&breakdown=true)

<br>

* **New Feature**: Added search command to search for applicant(s). (Pull request [\#67](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/67) [\#90](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/90) [\#118](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/118)).
    * What it does: Allows the user to search for applicant(s) using either 1 or multiple prefixes and attributes. User is able to search applicant(s) by name, job, round and skill.
    * Justification: This feature enhances the overall product as user is able to find applicant(s) they want to look for immediately. User can search for applicant(s) using multiple prefixes and attributes, and the search result will be sorted in descending number of matching attributes. 
    Hence, this command improves overall user experience as it provides an alternative to find applicant(s) without needing to look through the list and search for applicant(s) one-by-one.
    * Highlights: Allow search to search for applicant using partial matching of an exact word and allow the search result to be sorted according to the number of matching attributes.
    * Credits: Credits to Goel and Ryan Cheung for enhancing search command to allow search to work with round and skill. Credits to all my teammates for suggesting ways to improve on search command.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Improve view command to only view on applicant using full name. User can search for a specific applicant using view (Pull request [\#50](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/50)).
    * Added confirmation box for clear command. This prevents user from clearing the data by accident. (Pull request [\#153](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/153)).
    * Added checking for input prefixes and display error message if the input prefix is invalid. (Pull request [\#228](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/228)).
