Given below are my contributions to the project.

# Overview

### I have updated the storage system of our project, to make it able to store the correct info into the JSON format by creating many JSONAdapted classes. I have also make initial update to the UI of the project. I also made contribution in adding new features like `EditSellerCommand` and `DeleteSellerCommand` and added a lot of test cases in `EditSellerCommandTest`, `EditBuyerCommandTest`, and are in charge of removing unused classes. In order to maintain the code coverage, I have made a lot of changes to maintain the code quality for our team project.

* **Code contributed**:
    * ```House``` Class
    * ```HouseType``` Enum Class
    * ```PriceRange``` Class
    * ```Location``` Class
    * ```HouseTest``` Class
    * ```PriceRangeTest``` Class
    * ```EditSellerCommand``` Class and its Test cases
    * ```JsonAdaptedBuyer``` Class and its Test cases

    * ```JsonAdaptedHouse``` Class and its Test cases
    * ```JsonAdaptedPriceRange``` Class

    * Make initial changes about FXML and FXML related classes to make sense in rendering information in UI
    * Improve the Storage system of the project by adding a lot of JSON related classes
    * Removing the unused classess and the old Addressbook classes.
    * Add more test cases into the project to cover more code and minimize the bug possiblity

* **Project management**:
    * Fixed a bug on the project [\#84](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/84)
    * Give ideas to teammates while planning on the next iteration
    * Actively discuss with teammates in order to maintain the consistency in our project
    * Increase code coverage by adding more test cases.
    * Add issues in the Github to keep track of the progress in out project.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Update documentation for the command `add`
        * Update documentation for the file system, explain about the data structure of our JSON format in details
