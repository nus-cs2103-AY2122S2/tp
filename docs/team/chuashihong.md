    * Added `edit-s` command feature
        * What it does: This command allows the user to edit the details of a seller
        * Justifications: The basic CRUD command for the seller information.
        * Credits: The feature was implemented by referring to [AddressBook Level 3
          (AB3)](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) edit person command. Some part of the codes were adapted and modified.
    * Added `delete-s` command features
        * What it does: Delete a seller by the given `index` from the user
        * Justifications: The basic CRUD command for the seller information
        * Credits: The feature was implemented by referring to [AddressBook Level 3

    * Added `property` features into the `buyer` and `seller`
        * What it does: This feature is to store the key information from a buyer and a seller, it is to show the
          information of the property that a buyer/seller wish to buy/sell.
        * Justifications: This is the essential information for both a buyer and a seller, and it is made associated with buyer/seller.
          The `match` command also uses the property feature to match a buyer and with many sellers.
        * Highlights: This feature is implemented using OOP concept.
    * Improve the storage system of the project
        * Created a lot of classes like `JSONAdaptedBuyer/Seller`, `JSONAdaptedProperty` and related properties classes
          to make the storage system be able to store essential information about buyers and sellers, `propertyToBuy`and `propertyToSell`
        * Updated the `model` class and the `logicManager` class to match the current implementation
        * Updated the JSON format that the app saves, and the ability to read the files.
        * Remove unused storage related files like `Client` related classes.
    * Update the UI of the project
        * Let buyers and sellers be able to show its eseestial information on the UI

    * Code quality control of the project
        * Delete all unused files and commented out codes
        * Make sure all naming conventions of the files are appropriate by refactoring the classes' name and methods' name
        * Added test cases for `EditSeller` and `EditBuyer` classes
        * Added test cases for `Storage` related classes
