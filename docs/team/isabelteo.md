### Project: TrackBeau

TrackBeau is a desktop application built for beauty salons to manage their customer base. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: 
* Added feature to obtain summary data on customer information such as pie charts on customer attributes and line chart on customers gained per month in the current year. A total of 7 chart commands were added to enable experienced users with a large customer base to easily understand their customer demographics.
** Challenges faced: Explored different design considerations such as a statistics panel with all charts and later decided on a pop-up window style for the charts to facilitate access to the charts. 

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-02-18&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=isabelteo&tabRepo=AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **Project management**:
    * Contributed to discussions on user stories to prioritise and relating code between different features.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Added attributes to customers for salons to track such as birthday, registration date, skin type, hair type, preferred staff, preferred services and allergies.
    * Added feature to find by registration date and birthdate.
    * Made customers unique by phone number and email, rather than just by name, to facilitate the implementation of other features like Booking.
   
* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Contributed to the documentation for commands relating to customers.
        * Wrote the documentation for commands relating to plotting charts.
        * Fixed documentation flaws in the user guide.
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added the manual testing cases
        * Added the chart sequence diagram for plot command implementations
        * Made the add customer sequence diagram for implementation of add customer
