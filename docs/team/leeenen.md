### Project: TAlent Assistant™

#### Overview ####
TAlent Assistant™ is a **desktop, lightweight and centralized management system** catered to NUS School of Computing professors for managing
the interview scheduling process of candidates applying to be undergraduate Teaching Assistants (TA). It is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * Implemented `Candidate` `Availability` status.
  * Auto deletion of interviews that are past the allocated interview timing.
  * Implemented placeholder with randomized colour for each candidate's background photo in the `focusPanel` of the application.
  * UI improvements of `FocusCard`. 


* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=leeenen&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-02-18&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=LeeEnEn&tabRepo=AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
