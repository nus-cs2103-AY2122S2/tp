### Project: LinkedOUT

LinkedOUT is the only application that any experienced recruiter needs.

LinkedOUT allows recruiters to keep track of many applicants, and the job they applied for. You can store their contact details, skills and the round of their application, all in one place.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort list of applicants. 
  (Pull Request [\#121](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/121))
    * What it does: allows the user to temporarily sort the list of applicants in ascending or descending alphabetical order based on either job applied or name of applicant.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can view the applicants in a more organised manner when needed.
    * Highlights: The implementation require the use of comparators and comparables.
    * Credits: Ryan Tan(@ryantanlien), Ryan Cheung(@RyanCheungJF) and Kai Yi Chen(@kaiyichen) for reviewing
      and assisting in fixing the bug where any command done on the sorted list was done on the default list
      instead which created huge inaccuracies.
