### Project: IBook

IBook is an inventory recording system for storekeepers to manage incoming and outgoing products in a store.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
- **New Feature** : Expired command
  * What it does: Allow users to find items that are already expired.
  * Justification: User does not need to look through every item to find out which item has expired.
- **New Feature** : Out-of-Stock command
  * What it does: Allow users to find products that are out of stock.
  * Justification: User does not need to look through every product to find which is out of stock.
- **New Feature** : Remind command
  * What it does: Allow users to find items that are expiring within a certain time from now.
  * Justification: User does not need to look through every product to find which product is expiring soon.
