## Summary of Contribution

* **Code Contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=ckcherry23&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-02-18&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)


* **Enhancements Implemented**:
  * Implemented storage functionality for the meetings list and for the new attributes in persons list:
    [#44](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/44),
    [#122](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/122).

  * Implemented a new feature to `delete` specific fields of a contact and added tests for it:
    [#81](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/81),
    [#229](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/229).

  * Enhanced the `clear` command by asking for user confirmation. Created a new `ConfirmWindow` with reusability in 
    mind for any future commands that require user confirmation:
    [#82](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/82).

  * Enhanced the `help` command by opening the user guide directly from the _Help Window_ rather than allowing the user 
    to copy the user guide URL to improve UX:
    [#36](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/36).

  * Implemented the `back` command that takes the user back to the _Home Page_ from the _Contact Details Page_:
    [#76](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/76).
  
  * Implemented changes to allow creation of contacts with the same name as long as tags are different. This takes into 
    consideration that multiple contacts may have the same full name, but still helps us keep our contacts unique:
    [#96](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/96).
  
  * Implemented setting focus to the command box after navigation to decrease number of mouse clicks and improve UX:
    [#131](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/131).
  
  * Fixed tests after the implementation of multiple fields for phones, addresses and emails: 
    [#39](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/39),
    [#46](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/46).
  
  * Updated the GUI color scheme: 
    [#218](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/218).

    [#111](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/111).

### 5.3 Delete fields feature
The **delete fields** feature can be used to delete fields stored for the
contacts. This feature is also restricted to the Contact Details Page,
which can be accessed after the _add_ or _view_ commands. It is mainly
facilitated by the `ContactDetailsPageParser`, `DeleteFieldCommandParser`
and `DeleteFieldCommand` classes.

_Note:_ This feature is different from the **delete contacts** feature,
which is only accessible on the Home Page.

#### 5.3.1 Design considerations:
Since certain fields allow for multiple values to be stored, the user needs
to specify the label of the value (or the value itself for non-labelled
fields) they want to delete along with the field to be deleted for such
fields.

**Aspect: What happens when the user does not specify a label or value:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete all the values stored for this
  field immediately.
  * Pros:
    * Seems to be the most intuitive approach.
    * Easier to implement.
    * Faster to execute command.
  * Cons:
    * User may have forgotten to mention the label or field, which could
      lead to unintended loss of data.

* **Alternative 2 :** Confirm that the user wants to delete all values for
  this field
  * Pros:
    * Allows user to cancel the command if it was unintentional.
  * Cons:
    * Slower to execute command.
    * Difficult to implement, since the current implementation does not
      store command history.

We picked _alternative 1_ since the focus of our CLI app is on speed and
efficiency. Additionally, _alternative 2_ required a lot of changes to the
existing implementation which would not be very helpful for executing other
commands.

### 5.4 Clear all data feature
The **clear all data** feature can be used to delete all the contacts
and meetings stored by the user. Since deleted data cannot be recovered,
the app opens a pop-up window asking for user confirmation before any
data is cleared.

The following sequence diagram shows how the clear operation works:

This activity diagram summarises the possible paths of executing the _clear_
command:

### 8.4 Deleting fields
1. Deleting only particular fields of a contact

  1. Prerequisites: Have at least one contact stored with multiple phone
     numbers, tags, pronouns and the job title and view their details with
     the `view <INDEX NO>` command. These test cases must be followed in
     order.

  2. Test case: `del` <br>
     Expected: No field is deleted. An error message is shown in the Result
     Display.

  3. Test case: `del ph` <br>
     Expected: No field is deleted. An error message is shown in the Result
     Display.

  4. Test case: `del ph/ <LABEL OF FIRST PHONE NUMBER>` <br>
     Expected: The first phone number is deleted while the rest are still
     displayed in the contact details.

  5. Test case: `del t/` <br>
     Expected: All the tags of the person displayed are deleted. <br>
     Exception: If there is another contact with the same name as this
     contact but without any tags, this command will result in an error
     and no fields will be deleted.

  6. Test case: `del pr/ j/` <br>
     Expected: All the pronouns and the job title of the person displayed
     are deleted.

  7. Test case: `del j/` <br>
     Expected: No field is deleted. An error message is shown in the Result
     Display.
