## Project: TeachWhat!
TeachWhat! is a desktop address book application used for private tutors in managing their class. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

## Enhancements implemented
1. Implemented a feature allowing users to add temporary lessons (pull-request [#61](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/61)), which includes
   - creating a UI representation of a lesson
   - creating the relevant models for a lesson and the abstraction of a list of lessons
   - adding logic to handle the parsing of the command
2. Added logic to check for any conflicts between temporary lessons (pull-request [#57](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/57))
   - What it does: Prevents the user from adding a lesson that clashes with an existing one.
3. Implemented a feature that refreshes the UI to display a list of conflicting lessons (pull-request [#144](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/144))
   - What it does: When the user tries to add a lesson that conflict with some existing lesson(s), the lesson list on the UI will be refreshed to show a list of such conflicting lessons.
4. Implemented a feature to search for lessons by name and/or subject (pull-request [#136](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/136))
5. Updated a feature to search for students by name and/or tags (pull-request [#141](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/141))
6. Added persistence for lessons added (pull-request [#75](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/75))

## Contributions to the UG
1. Contributed to the UG for `addlesson` command (pull-request [#136](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/161))
   - how `TeachWhat!` would inform the user if the lesson added is conflicting with existing ones and what he/she can do.
2. Added a section on the `clear` command (pull-request[#236](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/236))
3. Fixed typos in the `findlessons` and `findstudents` command (pull-request[#235](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/235))

## Contributions to the DG
1. Added use-cases for the main user-stories, specifying the actions a user would perform to achieve the intended outcome. (pull-request [#64](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/64))
2. Added [class-diagrams](https://github.com/jamesyeap/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#model-component) for the `Model` component, along with a brief description of the key classes and associations between them
3. Added [sequence-diagrams](https://github.com/jamesyeap/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#add-temporaryrecurring-lesson) that explain how the `addlesson` command is implemented.
4. Added instructions on how to test the saving of data in TeachWhat! (pull-request [#265](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/265))

## Contributions to team-based tasks
1. Set up the team's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/orgs/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/teams/developers)
2. Set up code-coverage tracking on [CodeCov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/)
3. Set up and updated the [Index page](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w11-3.github.io/tp/) of the project's website, including
   - changing the header to `TeachWhat!`
   - updating the links to the **Java-CI** and **CodeCov** status-banners
   - updating the link to the project's GitHub repository
4. Added issues and corresponding labels for features to be implemented in [Milestone v1.2](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/milestone/1)

## Review/mentoring contributions
1. Helped a teammate fix a bug in the UI in pull-request [#68](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/68/commits/f9a1e313b5c7ff150fc590e5df98ef6c2ff00664).
2. Occasionally fixed minor merge-conflicts encountered while merging pull-requests from teammates.
3. Suggested the use of `FXCollections.sort()` to fix a bug with sorting lessons by date in the UI.
4. Fixed styling of class-diagram for the Logic component in pull-request [#261](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/261/commits/adb69157d2af6d514c5f6e44355b4059e0506cd6)

## Contributions beyond the project team
1. Provided an [alternative solution](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S2/forum/issues/58#issuecomment-1025671937) to an issue faced by another student in the iP.
