### Project: Automated Insurance Assistant (AIA)

Automated Insurance Assistant (AIA) is a desktop application that helps insurance agents manage their client contacts.

This is a brownfield Java project that is built on [AddressBook Level-3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3)
with an addition of approximately 10KLoC. Forking workflow is used throughout the project.
