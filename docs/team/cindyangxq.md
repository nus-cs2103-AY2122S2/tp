### Project: AddressBook Level 3

RealEstatePro is a desktop application for managing your client details for real estate agents.
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). 
With RealEstatePro managing your clients will be a breeze by using the various features such as reminders, client matching and many more!

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added `match` function (Pull Request [#51](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-4/tp/pull/51)).

* **New Component**: Added `Preference` attribute (Pull Request [#79](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-W16-4/tp/pull/79)).
