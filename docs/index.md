**LibTask** is a desktop application to allow librarians to keep track of book statuses and contact details of patrons who have borrowed them or requested for them. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using LibTask, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing LibTask, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
