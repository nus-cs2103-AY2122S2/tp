**WoofAreYou is a desktop application for pet daycare owners to handle the administrative information of their pets.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using WoofAreYou, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/12056c1a33e733023afd53078a36a812c0c7edee/docs/UserGuide.md#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing WoofAreYou, the [**Developer Guide**](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/12056c1a33e733023afd53078a36a812c0c7edee/docs/DeveloperGuide.md) is a good place to start.
