**UNite** is a desktop application  for university students, school admins and teaching assistants who prefer to use a platform with a simplistic UI to keep track of each otherâ€™s contact information.

* If you are interested in using UNite, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing AddressBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
