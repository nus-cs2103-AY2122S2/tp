NUSearch is a **desktop app for managing NUS staff contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). <br>
If you can type fast, NUSearch can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI applications.

* If you are interested in using NUSearch, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing NUSearch, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
