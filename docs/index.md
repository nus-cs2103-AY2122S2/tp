**LinkedOUT** is the only application that any **experienced recruiter needs.** \
It allows recruiters to **keep track of many applicants, and the job they applied for.** \
You can **store** their contact details, skills and the round of their application, **all in one place**.

* If you are interested in using LinkedOUT, the [**User Guide**](UserGuide.html) is a good place to start.
* If you are interested about developing LinkedOUT, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
