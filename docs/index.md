**UniBook is a desktop application for students that provides them with a way to manage university contacts related to their studies in an organised manner.
While it has a graphical user interface (GUI) with basic navigation functionality, it is primarily optimized for command line interface (CLI)** 

* If you are interested in using UniBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing UniBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
