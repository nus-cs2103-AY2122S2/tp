**ClientConnect is a desktop application for managing your clients' details and insurance packages.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Add Tags with varying levels of priorities to keep track of utmost important tasks to utilize your time efficiently, sort your clients by priority so you won't miss out urgent tasks to be done, conveniently import and export your client contacts, and easily find the client details you want through our `find` command. 

Not to mention we have convenience built-in for you: allowing you to undo and redo commands, and go back to what you previously typed just with a click of an up or down key! Many other features available in the User Guide.
