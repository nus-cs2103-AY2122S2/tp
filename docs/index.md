**UniGenda is a desktop application for managing your contact details and schedules.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). If you are a university student who types fast and wants to organize your busy schedule, UniGenda is the right app for you!

* If you are interested in using UniGenda, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing UniGenda, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
