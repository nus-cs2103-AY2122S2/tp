**TAddressBook is a desktop application for CS2030S Teaching Assistants (TAs) to keep track of students and their lab assignments**.
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* If you are interested in using TAddressBook, head over to the *Quick Start* section of the **[User Guide](https://ay2122s2-cs2103-f10-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start)**.
* If you are interested about developing TAddressBook, the **[Developer Guide](https://ay2122s2-cs2103-f10-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html)** is a good place to start.
* This project is based on the [AddressBook Level 3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
