**Coach2K22 is a contact management application that helps busy sports coaches organise their overwhelming lists of contacts and messy weekly schedules. It also provides them with a platform to visualise defensive and offensive plays as the game unfolds.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Example usages:
* as a contact management utility for his players and relevant contacts
* as a visualiser for real-time play to aid decision making on the fly
* as an organisation tool for teams and organisations
