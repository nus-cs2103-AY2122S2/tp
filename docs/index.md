**IBook is a desktop application for managing incoming and outgoing products of a store.** While it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions happen through a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using iBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing iBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
