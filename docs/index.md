# InternBuddy


**InternBuddy** is a desktop app for managing companies for internships, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, InternBuddy can get your internship management deliverables done faster than traditional GUI apps.

### What can InternBuddy do?

InternBuddy provides you a way to plan and organize all your internship details on a single application, with intuitive
UI to make your Job Seeking journey a smooth road.

InternBuddy allows you to:
* Store and manage Companies
* Manage Contacts
    * For example:  Hiring Manager Contact Details
* Manage Events
    * For example: Interviews and Online Assessments

### Why InternBuddy?

We believe that your time is precious. Rather than spending your time to organise your 
internship particulars, you should utilise your time to improve your skills towards success such as 
preparing your interview skills. With that, let InternBuddy works its magic to organise and manage your internship applications.

However, InternBuddy really shines for managing a huge number of applications. The ease of filtering through
all the details with just a few keyboard clicks is a lightning fast feature that you will not encounter 
using common GUI applications.
